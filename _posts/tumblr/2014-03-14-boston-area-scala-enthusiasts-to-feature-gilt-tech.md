Gilt Lead Software Engineer (and MIT grad) Yoni Goldberg will head to his old hometown of Boston to present a talk at the April 3 Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts meetup. Yoni will discuss our distributed Scala micro-services architecture, and describe some of the technological innovations that have helped Gilt to reach its current size. He’ll also highlight some of the core challenges that the company’s engineering team continues to face, and address what every tech team needs to consider  before heading down the path of building a first-class micro-services architecture. Pizza and beer provided. RSVP here!
