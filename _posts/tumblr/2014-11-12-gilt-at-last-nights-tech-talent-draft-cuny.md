That’s Gilt Senior Program Manager Fidan Kasra on the far right of the photo, speaking on last night’s NYC Tech Talent Draft panel (she’s in the middle) at CUNY. Fidan shared the panelist table with representatives from other major NYC tech companies, including BaubleBar, Shutterstock and Zenly. The NYC Tech Talent Draft is an initiative by the NYC Economic Development Corporation to help computer science and engineering students to connect and hear from working professionals in the tech industry. Gilt is thrilled to participate in the talent draft for the second year in a row!
