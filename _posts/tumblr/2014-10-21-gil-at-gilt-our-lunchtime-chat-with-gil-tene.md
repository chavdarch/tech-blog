The #gilttech team recently had the great pleasure of hosting a lunchtime talk by Gil Tene, CTO and co-founder of Azul Systems, at our 2 Park office. Gilt cofounder/CTO Michael Bryzek and Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg, both of whom presented at this summer’s QCon NY, met Gil at the conference and were impressed by his amazing talk about performance on the JVM (check out a two-hour version of his talk here). Gil generously shared his knowledge and expertise on latency, measurement (particularly errors of omission of data) and garbage collection (Azul produces a JVM that solves the garbage collection problem).  A huge thanks to Gil for spending the afternoon with us!
