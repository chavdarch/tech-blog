We’re excited to tell you that Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs will serve as a panelist at the New York City Economic Development Corporation’s next NYC Tech Talent Draft panel. Steve earned his PhD in Electrical Engineering from Columbia, and will join executives from Adobe, BuzzFeed, Fog Creek Software, and other top tech companies on the panel. He and other panelists will discuss “a day in the life” of a tech exec, how to land a tech job, and other topics. The panel takes place Tuesday, January 28 at Columbia University’s Davis Auditorium and runs from 6 to 7 PM; there’s an hour of networking afterward. You don’t have to be a Columbia student to attend the event, so RSVP here if you’d like to attend!
Many thanks to the NYCEDC for once again inviting Gilt to participate in their great events program!
