Scaling Happiness Horizontally (Video)

Basho has just published video from its recent RICON East 2013 conference in NYC—including this video from my talk, Scaling Happiness Horizontally. In my presentation, I discuss Gilt’s approach to scaling our distributed organization and spend a fair bit of time discussing the contents of our Scaling Agile at Gilt blog post—specifically, our methods of modeling our application architecture to influence team communication structures. There are a lot of similarities between scaling distributed computing systems and scaling organizations. (Gilt Tech is a distributed, peer-to-peer network.)

Go here to review the slides from my presentation.
