Earlier today the folks behind Gatling announced the release of Gatling 2.0.0-RC1–and also their new website, which mentions Gilt as a user! In case you’re not familiar, Gatling is an open source load-testing framework based on Scala, Akka and Netty. Congrats to the Gatling team for both achievements.
