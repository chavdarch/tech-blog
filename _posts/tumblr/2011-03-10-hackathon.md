CNN stopped by Gilt HQ to cover our first Hackathon of 2011. The 24-hour hacking extravaganza produced more than a dozen ideas. Features included using your iPhone’s camera to find products that coordinate with the color of anything you point it at, to umbrella sales that activate when it starts raining near you.
Read the CNN story and check out some pictures from the event.
