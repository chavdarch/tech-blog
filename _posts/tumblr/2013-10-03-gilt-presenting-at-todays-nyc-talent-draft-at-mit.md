Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg traveled to Boston, MA today to represent for Gilt Tech at the NYC Tech Talent Draft at MIT. Yoni  received his master’s of engineering and undergraduate degrees from MIT (course 6, ‘09 and ''10) and belonged to the Number Six Club/Delta Psi. While at MIT he launched BooksPicker, a website that makes it easy to buy and sell textbooks. Today he serves as the tech lead of Gilt’s personalization team, which develops new ways to deliver more relevant sales and products to the company’s millions of customers.
Organized by the New York City Economic Development Corp. (NYCEDC), the Tech Talent Draft gives NYC-based technologists the opportunity to reach out  to computer science students at top universities and describe the many opportunities available in NYC’s bustling tech job market. Thanks to the NYCEDC for letting us be a part of it!
