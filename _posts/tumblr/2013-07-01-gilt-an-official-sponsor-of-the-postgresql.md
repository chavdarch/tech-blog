Gilt has officially become a Silver Sponsor of this year’s PostgreSQL Conference Europe, which will take place October 29 through November 1 in Dublin, Ireland (where we have an office). PGConf.EU, as it’s otherwise known, is the largest PostgreSQL conference in Europe and involves most of Europe’s user groups. In addition to talks in English, German, Dutch and other languages, the conference will include a full day of short PostgreSQL training sessions. Registration for the conference hasn’t begun yet, but if you’re interested in presenting, you’re in luck: the deadline for talk proposals runs through July 22, 2013.
