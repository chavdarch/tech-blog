Gilt’s iPhone and iPad apps now allow our customers to quickly re-apply the size filters they have previously used. To filter a sale by your sizes, simply tap on the “Refine by Your Sizes” button. If you haven’t previously filtered by size on our apps, use the “Refine” feature to do so and the next time you visit a sale you’ll be able to use this quick shortcut.
 
In developing this feature, we’ve aimed to make shopping on Gilt even simpler and more delightful than ever. Let us know what you think by emailing our mobile team at iphonefeedback@gilt.com!
