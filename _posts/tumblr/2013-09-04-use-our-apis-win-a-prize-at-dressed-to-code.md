This Saturday we’ll give a super-brief presentation on our APIs (and drink our morning coffee) at Dressed to Code: an all-day hackathon organized by Glamour magazine and the Council of Fashion Designers of America and hosted by General Assembly. Hackathon participants will create games, apps and tools that emphasize shopping, assembling stylish outfits, and other sartorial activities, and compete for a variety of cash and business development-oriented prizes. Spots are sold-out, but you can tweet support and encouragement to your participating friends and colleagues by using the hashtag #DressedToCode.
