We’re super-excited to welcome Gary LosHuertos to Gilt Tech! Gary joins our personalization team–the crew that focuses on our personal sales and other sexy initiatives–as a Senior Software Engineer and will work remotely from Gainesville, Florida (he’ll also visit us in NYC every once in a while). Gary recently co-founded a start-up and participated in the TechStars program, so he’s no stranger to NYC.
Outside of work, Gary enjoys catching up with HBO’s many popular shows, eating at some of Gainesville’s “(few) wonderful restaurants,” and “adding fluffy descriptive adjectives to my sentences.”
