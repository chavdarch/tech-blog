If performance issues are making you feel like King Kong–i.e., disgruntled and prone to going on a rampage–then head on over to the Empire State Building next Wednesday and get some relief. Gilt Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek will appear at the next New York Front End Coders meetup to explain how Gilt analyzes web performance using RUM and synthetic monitoring as well as the W3C Performance Timing API. He’ll give a couple examples of recent performance issues at Gilt and how our tech team has integrated performance into our workflow. By the end, you should feel rather enlightened and calm–more like Curious George than a monster gorilla.
Also on the bill will be Nathaniel Lee, who will discuss “Leveraging Functional Programming in JS.” Go here to RSVP (and do it before Monday, January 26).
