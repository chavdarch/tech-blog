Here’s the video of last week’s NY Technology Council presentation featuring Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek. There’s still one event left in the Tech Council’s Gilt-centric “Built to Scale” series: Gilt Senior Systems Business Manager Susan Thomas’ “Bridging the Communication Gap Between Product Managers & Stakeholders” on Thu 10/10. RSVP here. (Check back here soon for video of “The Art of Personalization,” last night’s presentation by Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer.)
Update: Jesse Landry has posted a nice recap of the event here.
