We’re excited to announce that Gilt CTO and co-founder Michael Bryzek and Lead Software Engineer Jim Englert are featured presenters at the next NYC Riak meetup, which we’ll host at our Manhattan office on Tuesday, September 17. Michael will start off the evening with a brief intro, and Jim will give a presentation based on his recent account of our Riak stress test in Dublin. Rounding out the evening is Basho Technologies evangelist Tom Santero, who will discuss the next generation of Riak search. RSVP for the event–officially titled “Riak in Silicon Alley: Why Distributed Databases Should Matter To You”–at the link.
