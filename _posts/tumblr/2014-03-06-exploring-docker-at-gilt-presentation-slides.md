Last night Gilt and the Hacker Union–a nonprofit connector and mentorship organization led by hackers, for hackers–co-hosted a fun and informative Hacker Forum on continuous delivery and provisioning. The night’s speakers included Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky (pictured above) and Huffington Post Principal Systems Engineer Mike Adler. More than 100 technologists from AppNexus, HBO, O''Reilly and other companies joined us for presentations, pizza and conversation!
Some highlights:

Dinner time!

Gilt Personalization Team Engineers Achia Shaag and Giancarlo Silvestrin catch up after a day’s work.

Nice to see Imperative CTO Blue Thomas (center) at our office again!

Your author steals the mike from Hacker Union organizer Brandon Diamond, who directed our 100+ guests to the conference room for the presentation kick-off.
Jon Leibiusky was the night’s first speaker. His slides (drum roll please):
 
(Relevant bonus link: “PostgreSQL Setup Using Docker,” a talk that Gilt Engineer Rangarajan Radhakrishnan gave in December!)

The audience follows along …

Brandon introduces Mike Adler, who discussed the merits of different provisioning tools and introduced AWSHeet, which he describes as “a handy, if imperfect, way to provision resources.”

Many people stuck around after the presentations to mingle and have another beer.
Thanks to Hacker Union and our guests for a great evening!
Our next meetup at Gilt takes place on March 18, when Gilt Principal Software Engineer Adam Kaplan presents “Using Akka to Scale Gilt’s Massive Push Notification System.” Our partner for that event is the New York Mobile App Developer (NYCMAD) meetup. Hope to see you there!
