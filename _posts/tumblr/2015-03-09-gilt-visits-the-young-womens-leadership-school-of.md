Director of Product, Chrissy Fleming, and Senior Business Systems Manager, Susan Thomas, attended the “Cool Women, Hot Jobs” event held at The Young Women’s Leadership School of the Bronx (TYWLS). “Cool Women, Hot Jobs” is a program that is designed to expose the 6-8 grade students of TYWLS to strong, smart, and successful role models who are willing to share wisdom, advice, and experiences from their professional journey. It also provides a deeper understanding of the many career options that await once the young women graduate college.Susan was really excited to share with the girls that being a member of a Technology department doesn’t mean that you are a coder or an engineer and that there are many options that are available. “Everyone is their own recipe. We are all made up of different ingredients. It’s about knowing your ingredients and then picking things you like,” Susan says.Chrissy recalls, “That you don’t have to know what you want to be when you grow up, that there are jobs out there you’ve never heard of that you might be really great at and the funny thing was, this applied to maybe 1 in 4 of the girls. The others had no problems letting me know what they wanted to be when they grow up!”Chrissy and Susan were so thrilled to be apart of this special event focused around inspiring the young community. They can’t wait for the next TYWLS event!
