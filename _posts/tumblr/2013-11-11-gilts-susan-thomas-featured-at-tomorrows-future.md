Gilt Senior Business Systems Manager Susan Thomas is a featured speaker at tomorrow (11/12)’s Future of Collaboration & Internal Communications Summit in NYC. Organized by the Business Development Institute, which produces conferences and educational programs for marketing, communications and media professionals, the summit will focus on ways that companies can use social technologies to improve productivity and communications with employees and third-party partners. Susan will be interviewed by Ira Gottlieb, president and founder of NuWave Communications and former Vice President of Global Communications at Tyco.
