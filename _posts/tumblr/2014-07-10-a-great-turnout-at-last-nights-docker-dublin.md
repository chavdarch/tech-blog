More than 90 Dublin technologists came out to Docker Dublin’s inaugural meetup, co-organized by Gilt! Here’s Docker Dublin founder/organizer John Zanchetta kicking off the event:

And here’s Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek, the main presenter of the night, describing how our engineering team has been using Docker and AWS to deliver immutable software releases to production:

The Docker Dublin group has tons of potential, and we’re very excited to be working with John to help the group expand. If you’d like to give a talk at an upcoming meetup, please send an email (include your suggested topic) via the DD meetup page. Then follow the group’s Twitter account to receive news and updates!
