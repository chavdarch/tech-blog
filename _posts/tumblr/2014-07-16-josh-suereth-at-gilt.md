Here’s Typesafe Senior Software Engineer/Scala In Depth author Josh Suereth earlier this week at Gilt’s NYC office, teaching his sbt workshop. Josh spent more than two hours covering settings, configurations, dependency management, and other topics. More than 50 non-Gilt technologists from the metro NYC area joined members of our engineering team for dinner and the class.
If you’re curious about sbt but couldn’t attend the workshop, check out Josh’s presentation from the 2014 Northeast Scala Symposium:
