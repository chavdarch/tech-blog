Here’s Gilt Principal Software Engineer giving his talk on Scala self-types during the Dublin Scala Users Group’s most recent meetup, which took place earlier this week at Engine Yard’s Dublin office. In his talk, Gregor explained how to use self-types to assemble application components at compile time and examine the problems and risks involved in using self-types. He also discussed Scala-style dependency injection and showed how self-types are a typesafe alternative to Spring and other DI frameworks. Check out his slides here:
