We’re excited to welcome Jenny Leahy to the Gilt technology team! Jenny will be working in our Dublin office as a software engineer, and will initially focus on email delivery. A longtime Java developer with experience working in the financial software field, she’s moving into the world of Scala and is intrigued by our use of the Typesafe platform. When she’s not working, she loves to read (sci-fi, psychology and anthropology) and travel.
