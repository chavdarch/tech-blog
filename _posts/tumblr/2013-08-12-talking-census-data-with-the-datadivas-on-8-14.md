We’re pleased to announce that Gilt Database Administrator and Data Engineer Elon Azoulay will be the featured speaker at the DataDivas meetup group’s August 14 Fireside Chat (RSVP here). Elon will describe his recent work aggregating U.S. Census and American Community Survey data at the ZIP code level to better understand the demographic profile of our customers. He’ll also discuss why governments should adopt open-data policies. Hope to see you there!
