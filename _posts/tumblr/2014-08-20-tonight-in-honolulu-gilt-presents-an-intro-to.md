By day, Senior Software Engineer Yoshi Sugawara works on Gilt’s Personalization team. By night–or at least tonight–he presents on Swift! As the featured speaker of the Organization for the Understanding of Dynamic Languages’ August meetup, Yoshi will deliver a Swift primer and answer questions. Regular readers of this blog are likely to expect meetups we announce here to take place either in NYC, Dublin (Ireland, not Ohio) or (to a lesser extent) Portland (Oregon, not Maine), but tonight’s (Aug. 20) meetup takes place at the Manoa Innovation Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. RSVP here.
