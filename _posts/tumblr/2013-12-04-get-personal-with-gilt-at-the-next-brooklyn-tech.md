How does Gilt apply personalization strategies to attract, interact with, and persuade customers to make high-end purchases? Find out at the Brooklyn Tech Meetup’s Dec. 10 event, featuring Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer! Eric will discuss what we call “smart serendipity”: the discovery of surprising, albeit personally relevant items. He’ll also explain how Gilt implements this strategy on our platform, both at the end-user interface and predictive affinity engine levels, to personalize shopping experiences for millions of users.
In addition to Erik’s talk, the meetup features presentations from the time-management app Sociidot and the consumer preference data outfit Have to Have, as well as “crazy views, rotating panels, and even interactive LED lighting!"  RSVP here to catch Erik’s talk (and those LED lights)!
