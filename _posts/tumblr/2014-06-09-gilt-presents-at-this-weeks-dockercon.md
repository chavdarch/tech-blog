DockerCon runs today and tomorrow (June 9-10) in San Francisco, and #gilttech is proud to be a part of it! Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek will present “Immutable infrastructure w/Docker and EC2,” a talk on our current efforts to move to the cloud and improve our disaster recovery capabilities. We’ll post the video from Michael’s talk when it becomes available; for now, learn more about our Docker work here.
