Gilt Tech are hosting a series of NYC events on technology innovation.
In the first of the series, “Exotic languages and the Web”, we’ll hear lightning talks on real-world uses of Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Erlang and CoffeeScript, followed by drinks and discussion.
We’re hosting this on October the 19th at the Carlton Hotel on Madison Ave. 
These events are open to the NY tech community and we’d love to have you join us! Find out more and sign up for the event at: http://exotic-web-languages.eventbrite.com. If you can’t make it, we’ll be streaming the event live here.
