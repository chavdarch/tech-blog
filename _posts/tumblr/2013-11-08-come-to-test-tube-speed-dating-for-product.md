If your start-up has just launched a new feature and seeks feedback from like-minded product managers, developers and designers, come to Test Tube on Thursday, Nov. 21 at Gilt’s 2 Park Ave. office. To attend, just RSVP here.
Founded by Delve News CTO Tom Weingarten and UX Designer Pierre Wooldridge, Test Tube has been described by the likes of PandoDaily as “speed dating for product feedback.”  It’s usability testing at its most fun!
HERE’S HOW IT WORKS: You bring your wireframes, sketches, and just-baked apps, and arrive with one clear task you want the user to achieve. For example, it could be navigating through your onboarding, posting an event, listing an item on your site, or taking and sharing a photo. Over the course of an hour-and-a-half, you’ll meet with five or six other start-ups and take turns giving and receiving feedback on each others’ products. You’ll have seven minutes to watch (and listen!) to another start-up interact with your product before the tables turn and you test their product, too.
We’ll kick things off with a short presentation by Gilt UX Researcher/Taxonomist Amy DeCicco on how Gilt does usability testing. Then Tom and Pierre will chat briefly about the basics of usability testing and share tips on how to get the most out of Test Tube.
ATTEND FOR FREE! Simply send a tweet to let people know you’re attending the the event, and Test Tube will refund your ticket. Be sure to include @testtubenyc and the link to meetup.com/testtube. All refunds will be processed the day after the event.
