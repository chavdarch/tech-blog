Payment Card IndustryA poem by Sam Kassoumeh
PCI, oh PCI, 200 requirements we must comply. From password settings to policies, The time has come to rotate the keys. Above and beyond the norm we go. Protect the cards that is our goal. Standing out in the ecommerce crowd, We take the steps to make our QSA proud. Passphrase A and passphrase B, Will be joined in digital matrimony. Fraudsters and hackers free or in the joint, You can’t see our cards so sorry to disappoint. And to the members we love so much, Your information cannot be touched. Your credit cards can’t be divulged, In gilt.com you may indulge.
