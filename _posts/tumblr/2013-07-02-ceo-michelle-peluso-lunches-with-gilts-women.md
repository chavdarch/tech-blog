Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso recently met with a group of the company’s women technologists to share some of her personal stories about being a business leader, wife, and mother, and to offer advice relevant to all professionals–regardless of gender. Over lunch, Peluso answered our questions about a wide range of topics–from how to handle uncomfortable workplace situations (answer: with grace) to how she met her husband (a mutual friend). Thanks to Michelle for taking time out of her busy schedule to meet with us and share some of her story!
Since late 2012, Gilt’s women technologists have been meeting informally to discuss leadership skills, work/life balance, and professional development. Our activities include reading books either by or for businesswomen, attending public events for women in technology, and working with nonprofits that aim to create more opportunities in technology for women and girls. On July 11 we’ll host Girls Who Code, an organization that promotes “gender parity in the computing fields.” More on Girls Who Code at Gilt to come in a future post!
