#gilttech does. To this end, we hosted a roundtable discussion last night featuring more than 25 representatives from some of NYC’s top girls- and women-in-tech organizations. We wanted to hear more about their experiences trying to involve girls and women in tech, and about the challenges they and/or their group members have faced along the way. Other goals:
To gather organizations working on helping girls and women enter the tech industry by providing coding instruction, mentoring, and other resources/forms of support
To put like-minded, successful organizers in touch and facilitate networking+brainstorming
To discuss bias (including the unconscious type) and ways to address/resolve it at different levels (from C- to team-)
To identify action items for the group to work on
Everyone brought valuable insights and a wealth of experience to the table, which made for a very lively and informative conversation. Participants focused on implementing positive changes that involve and benefit everyone in the tech industry (after all, more women = higher profits). The general consensus is that men need to be a part of our future conversations and our efforts to propose solutions.
Who attended?
Represented groups included:

I want to be a part of the conversation! How can I get involved?
Please tweet at us to let us know what you’d like to contribute. We’re specifically targeting founders and organizers of tech groups, but enthusiastic male allies are also welcome. (For more about male allies and advocates, read this very relevant study by the National Center for Women & Information Technology.)
