Is it Heather Fleming Week at Gilt? Sort of! (We are not complaining.) Here is AgileFM’s brand-new vodcast featuring Heather talking about her experiences working at Gilt for the past four years, and her “just enough process” approach. AgileFM–“radio for the Agile community–is produced by NYC-based Agile coach/trainer and Incrementor principal Jochen Krebs.
