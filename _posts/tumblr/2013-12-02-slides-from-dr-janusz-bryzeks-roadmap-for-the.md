If you were holiday-traveling last Tuesday night and couldn’t catch our featured tech talk by Dr. Janusz Bryzek–father of Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek, father of sensors, TSensors Summit chair, and all-around impressive person–learn a bit about what you missed by checking out the slide deck:
 
 Roadmap for the Trillion Sensor Universe – a Gilt-hosted, Internet of Things talk by Dr. Janusz Bryzek  from Gilt Tech Talks
With a festive spread of pies, cookies and cakes, presentations by three generations of Bryzeks, and an audience featuring the likes of Gilt founder Kevin Ryan and investor Nick Beim, Tuesday’s talk wasn’t just any other meetup. Thanks to everyone who joined us for Dr. Bryzek’s fascinating presentation!
