Stilettos by State: a Gilt Infographic
While working on our headlines-making preemptive shipping initiative, Gilt Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert got a bit curious about whether certain fashion preferences might be regional or universal (or not). He and Gilt Data Analyst Debbie Chung had some hunches about how favorite styles, colors, etc. might differ around the U.S. and Puerto Rico and, like any good data sleuths, started exploring.
First, they looked at dress colors to see which ones were most popular in which U.S. regions, and found out that black is, um, still the “new black” in every corner of the country. Then they explored how high-heel heights varied among U.S. states, and noticed that the range was pretty substantial. The results of their findings are here in this infographic, created by Rhianon Cha-os.
While doing this research, Igor had to learn more about women’s shoes than he’d otherwise like to admit–addressing the heel-height aspect of “ballet flats,” “booties,” “boots,” etc. and figuring out their differences. But Debbie and Igor’s hard work (and Igor’s slight discomfort) paid off: Now we have a look at how tastes in high heels differ across the U.S. and in Puerto Rico!
