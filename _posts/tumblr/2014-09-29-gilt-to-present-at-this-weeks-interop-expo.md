Starting today (September 29), New York City’s Jacob Javits Convention Center hosts Interop: a full week of keynotes, workshops, panels and talks by leading lights in the tech community. Late Night host Seth Meyers adds a touch of star power with his keynote address Wednesday, Oct. 1 at 9 AM–one of nine keynotes to take place through October 4. We’re more excited about the keynote to be given by Gilt Cofounder and CTO Michael Bryzek, who will focus on the importance of the open source ethos in driving innovation. Catch Michael’s talk on Thursday, Oct. 2 at 9 AM.
Your Gilt Tech Evangelist (that’s me) will also be appearing at Interop. I’ll speak on the Women in Technology panel along with Michele Chubirka (Senior Security Architect, Postmodern Security), Jennifer Jessup (General Manager, Interop & Cloud Connect, UBM Tech), Laurianne McLaughlin (Editor-In-Chief, InformationWeek), and Sash Sunkara (Co-Founder and CEO, RackWare). The panel begins at 12:15 PM and includes a luncheon. Lean in + lunch in.
