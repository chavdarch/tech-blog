Gilt extends a hearty welcome to Anders Holm, who joins our infrastructure team as a Senior Systems Engineer! Based in our Dublin office, Anders will focus on building and automating our production infrastructure. Originally from Sweden, he’s been interested in computers since he was little: “Got my first ‘puter when I was 8 years old–a Spectravideo 318 with an MSX cartridge expansion kit. Amazing machine,” he says. When he’s not ''puting, Anders can be seen flying planes, riding motorcycles (trial bikes, dirt bikes, sports bikes, customs to tourers), studying martial arts, and running a hypnotherapy clinic. We also hear that he wrestles tyrannosaurs, but can’t substantiate the rumor. Welcome, Anders!
