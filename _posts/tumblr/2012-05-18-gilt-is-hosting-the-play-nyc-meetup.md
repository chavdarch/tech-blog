Gilt is hosting the Play! NYC meetupThis Monday (May 21) Gilt will host the Play! NYC group in our shiny new office space.

A few of us at Gilt have really taken a liking to the Play! web framework, but we wanted to be able to connect with other engineers so we could share experiences and learn about this exciting new framework. We started this group to fill a void we saw in NYC.

The first meetup of the group will be an easy-going introduction to Play! 2. We’ll talk briefly about why Gilt has chosen Play for some of its new applications, and then turn it over to Peter Hausel, one of the core developers of Play.

Peter will be leading an informal session about the best practices surrounding Play development.

If you’re in the NYC area, a Play! expert, a Scala beginner, or just interested in what makes this web framework different, I encourage you to join the group and check out this first meetup.

This Monday, May 21st at 7:30 at Gilt’s offices, 2 Park Ave, 5th Floor.
