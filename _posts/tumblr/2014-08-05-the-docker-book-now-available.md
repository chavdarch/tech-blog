Our friend James Turnbull, the VP of Services at Docker, has just published a book that explains how to use Docker:

In this book, we’ll will walk you through installing, deploying, managing, and extending Docker. We’re going to do that by first introducing you to the basics of Docker and its components. Then we’ll start to use Docker to build containers and services to perform a variety of tasks.

You can get “the dead tree version” here, or the (much) cheaper eBook here.
