Gilt Senior Software Engineer Carlos Brito Lage has taken a liking to Elixir, and has created a natively implemented JSON encoder and decoder for it called Elixir JSON. Carlos’ project includes a convenient filter for the Dynamo web framework. Carlos is looking for contributors, so just ping him at his GitHub page if you’d like to contribute.
