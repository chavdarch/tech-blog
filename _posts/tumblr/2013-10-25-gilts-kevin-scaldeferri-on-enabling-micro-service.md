If you’ve read about Gilt’s microservices architecture but always wanted to learn more, you’re in luck: Here’s a video of Gilt Principal Engineer Kevin Scaldeferri presenting at last month’s Commercial Users of Functional Programming (CUFP) conference in Boston. Kevin’s talk focused on the evolution of Gilt’s production architecture from a single monolithic web application to a highly-distributed collection of more than 200 micro-services and small web applications. Structuring our services this way helps us to deploy and innovate faster and more efficiently.
