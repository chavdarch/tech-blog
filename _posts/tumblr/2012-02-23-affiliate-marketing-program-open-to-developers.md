It’s been great to hear from developers over the past two weeks about their plans for the Gilt Public API, and we can only imagine what’s in the works out there that we haven’t heard about yet! Meanwhile, back at Gilt HQ, we’re hard at work on adding more to the API— more data and more ways of accessing what you want in the easiest way possible.

In the meantime, though, I’m happy to announce that we’ve finally got everything in place to enable you to participate in the affiliate marketing program. By enrolling in this program and adding a single parameter to all the requests you pass in, you can earn a competitive 6% commission on all sales from referred customers. When you consider that the luxury items on Gilt lead to average total order values of $150, that adds up pretty quickly.



 

All the information you need to get started has been added to the Gilt Developer Portal; the technical information is on the main documentation page and information about how to sign up for the affiliate program is available on our FAQ. What are you waiting for?
