Hereâ€™s Gilt Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert leading his free Big Data Analysis with SQL class at our Manhattan office on Wednesday. Nearly 40 non-Gilt software engineers, data analysts and technologists joined 10 Gilt employees for the course (did I mention that it was FREE?). Thanks to everyone who attended!
Keep watching this space for upcoming announcements about free tech courses at Gilt in 2014. Meantime, check out some more pictures:

Lead Application Support Engineer Adam Straussner is all about Gilt Tech pride.

So is Lead QA Engineer Dave Singh, who brought his Gilt-branded notebook.
