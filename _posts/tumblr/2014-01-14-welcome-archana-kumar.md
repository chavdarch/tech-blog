Archana Kumar is a front-end engineer who recently joined our Gilt City team in NYC. Originally from India, she went to college in Melbourne, Australia and did her graduate studies at NYU. She’s excited to be working on the Gilt tech team, and has already earned a playful nickname around the office: “Who’s That?"  She has one dog, one husband, and a side career as a web-comic artist.
