New York City’s Atlassian User Group is celebrating their one-year anniversary with a (undoubtedly well-organized!) big party for the project and program management set, and we’re proud to say that Gilt Tech is going to be a part of the festivities! Gilt Senior Director, PMO Heather Fleming will present “Beyond the Crystal Ball: The Agile PMO” in advance of her appearance in September (along with Gilt Director of Program Management Justin Riservato) at the Atlassian Summit. Representatives from Venmo, Vector Media Group, Goldman Sachs, and NYU Langone Medical Center will also give talks on JIRA, HipChat and PM-related topics. The fun starts at 7 PM on August 21 at SNAP Interactive; go here to register.
