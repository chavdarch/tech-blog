Join Gilt Groupe for the Hearst Fashion Hack, the largest fashion hackathon of the year, where you could win $10,000+ to launch your fashion app!

The Hearst Fashion Hack (#HearstFashionHack) kicks off on Saturday, February 9 at 9:00 a.m. with welcoming introductions by Hearst followed by developers pitching their ideas and forming teams. Coding begins promptly at 1:00 p.m. and submissions are due exactly 24 hours later. On Sunday, prototypes will be presented to the judges. Special consideration will be given to apps that inventively connect readers and editors in real-time.

Tickets are limited. We welcome enthusiasts from all levels of fashion expertise, from corporate juggernauts to prominent young students. We look forward to having you at the Hearst Fashion Hack and helping you build your fashion dreams.
