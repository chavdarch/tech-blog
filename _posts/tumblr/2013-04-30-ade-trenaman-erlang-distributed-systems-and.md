ade-trenaman:

Erlang, Distributed Systems and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale
Found this photo on my phone - a real moment in time at Gilt New York! Steve Vinoski, who worked with Gregor and I back in the days of the seminal Irish tech startup IONA Technologies, came to Gilt one cold February night to give a talk on how Riak is implemented in Erlang - it’s a great talk, and a super introduction to Erlang. From left to right: Eric Bowman, Steve Vinoski, Gregor Heine, me, and Mike Bryzek. Too. Much. Fun.
