Terve, aloha, and nǐ hǎo are just a few ways the #gilttech and #giltpmo teams would like to welcome Mackenzie Nicholson, the newest business systems manager to join our Program Management Organization! This global citizen was born in Napa Valley, grew up in Hawaii, went to high school in Seattle, attended college in Chicago and New York, and spent a year living in Helsinki running her own American-style baked goods company while commuting to London and Hong Kong for the engineering consultancy Systra. (She’s already given us a presentation on making the best of travel reward programs!)
Fittingly, Mackenzie is currently working with our back office team, which works on Gilt’s international payments and logistics. We’re thrilled to have her. Welcome on board, Mackenzie!
