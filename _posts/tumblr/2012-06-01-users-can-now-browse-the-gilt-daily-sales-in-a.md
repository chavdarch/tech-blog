Users can now browse the Gilt daily sales in a native application for the Windows Mobile platform! codeArcher’s Glitter features gilt.com’s flash sales, making use of the Public API to pull in information on the curated sales as well as the products in those sales. If you’re rocking a Lumia or other Windows phone, check this app out and review it in the Windows Phone Marketplace!
