Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky continues to improve Jedis, his popular open source Redis Java client! Back in March, he released a version that included enhancements to JedisClusterâ€™s connection handling and JedisCluster multi-threading. Jedis 2.5.0, the latest version, features HyperLogLog support, makes ShardedJedisPool closeable, and includes even more JedisCluster fixes. Go here to check out the latest version and here to learn more about what Jedis can do.
