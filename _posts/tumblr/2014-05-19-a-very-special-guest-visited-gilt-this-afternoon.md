We’re definitely getting this week off to an unforgettable start!: Here’s Scala creator and Typesafe Chairman Dr. Martin Odersky with the Gilt tech team earlier today. Dr. Odersky spent an hour answering our questions about Scala, Java 8, and much more. Later tonight he returns to 2 Park to give a talk on “Scala–The Simple Parts.” Many thanks to Dr. Odersky for his generosity, and to Typesafe for helping us to organize today’s lunch and presentation!
