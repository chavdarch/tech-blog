Yesterday The Guardian published a Q&A with Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso. Just like the jewelry section on Gilt.com, the interview contains lots of gems–including this description by Michelle about our culture:

First of all, Gilt has always been a phenomenal mix of creativity, technology and analytics, and that kind of mix between super creative people and design people: you know, photographers, stylists, merchandise experts, web designers sitting alongside analytical and technology fire power. [It] is such an interesting combination and provides a very vibrant culture, a mix of right brain and left brain.
Secondly, Gilt has always been a super innovative and fast paced culture. It has to be. Everyday we’re putting on a new sale. Everyday, we’re changing with what we have in our warehouse. And so, that pace of innovation is always a part of the culture.
Third, I would say, there’s lot of celebration and fun at Gilt. We have to attract and attain the best people, so there’s so many different things we do to keep that culture vibrant and fun and innovative. We have this legendary Halloween party, picnics, pantries that are full of food, team events, shopping discounts. Just lots of things that make working at Gilt fun.
