Gilt Insider, our customer loyalty program, just turned one year old, and to celebrate we’re sharing presents!
Today all Insider benefits are half-off—meaning 2x the payback for your hard-earned points. This works for dollars off any order, free shipping, or even products in our curated rewards shops.

As a refresher: Insider members earn five points for every dollar spent on Gilt. These points can be redeemed either as cash, or for a rotating array of products, deals, and gift cards for our favorite brands.
Not a member yet? Join Now! Old news? Well look for some exciting, free new benefits to come your way this fall!
And in the meantime, cash in…
Let us know what you think of this and other new features by emailing us at productfeedback@gilt.com.
