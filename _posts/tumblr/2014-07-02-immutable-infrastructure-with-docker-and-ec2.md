Here’s Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek at last month’s Dockercon14 conference in San Francisco, discussing how our engineering team has been experimenting with Docker to improve and simplify end-to-end continuous delivery of our micro-services architecture. Next week Michael will give an updated version of his talk at the inaugural Docker Dublin meetup, hosted at Engine Yard!
Docker is releasing two videos per day from the conference–check them all out here.
