Gilt is ecstatic to welcome Felix Garcia Borrego to the #gilttech engineering team in Dublin! Felix (to clarify, that’s him on the left) will join our Real Time Team and help us to take our real time event system to the next level using Amazon Kinesis and other cloud technologies. Originally from Seville, Spain, Felix worked at his own start-up for about eight years, building both mobile apps and web apps. Recently he decided to move abroad and look for new adventures, and found his way to Gilt!
Like many on our team, Felix got his start in computer programming (and Lego) at a very early age. He’s just realized that Scala is a better language than Lego or Java for building reactive systems. “Programming is my hobby too, but I also enjoy practicing sports, traveling and reading science fiction novels,” he says. Welcome, Felix!
