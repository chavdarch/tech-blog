We all have a lot to do. Effective time/task management is essential. I’ve been using GTD (Getting Things Done) for a while now (a long while :)) and for me it comes down to the question, “How do you pick the next, best, most valuable thing to work on?”–basically answering the question of how to make the best use of the time you have.
Picking something from your list of urgent things to do is kind of easy, but how can you make sure you are not missing the opportunity/chance to work on something important, if you get the chance to do so?
For me, picking something from my important list comes down to two questions:
How much time do I have? Ten minutes? Thirty minutes? An hour?
Do I need other people to help me, or can I make progress on my own?
Doing something short on my own is easy. In general, it means that I try to pick a task that requires other people to be available and that takes a long time (an hour or more).


 More details on how to implement something like this can be found here.
