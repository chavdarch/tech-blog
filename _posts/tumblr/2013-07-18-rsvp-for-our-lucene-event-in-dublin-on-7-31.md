Gilt Tech is excited to announce that on Wed 7/31, we’ll host a don’t-miss Lucene presentation featuring LucidWorks CTO/cofounder Grant Ingersoll and Gilt Senior Engineer Ugo Matrangolo. This free event will take place at TCube, 32-34 Castle St., Dublin 2 and include pizza and beer. Doors open at 6:30 PM, with presentations beginning at 7 PM. Go here to RSVP.
In addition to his role at LucidWorks, Ingersoll is a Lucene and Solr committer and long-standing member of the Apache Software Foundation. He’ll discuss the latest and greatest capabilities in Lucene and Solr related to relevance, distributed search, and faceting, and explain how to leverage these capabilities to build fast, efficient, scalable, next-generation data driven applications. Matrangolo, a member of Gilt’s Stores Team, has played a vital role in developing and enhancing the Gilt’s search capabilities, and will focus on how Solr has enabled Gilt to provide a controlled and targeted search experience for its millions of customers in the face of intense, daily spikes in site traffic.
Please join us for what promises to be an enlightening and lively discussion!
