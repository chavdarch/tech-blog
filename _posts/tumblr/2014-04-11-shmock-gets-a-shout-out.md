Thanks to Alex Gorbatchev at npm awesome for blogging about Shmock, Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky’s Express-Based HTTP Mocking Library for Node.js! “Being able to mock APIs is a very powerful tool for BDD,” Alex writes. “You can prototype, design and test your consumer before implementing a line of code.”
