Tonight Gilt Tech heads back to Meetup HQ for the second time in a week for the NY Data Wizards’ October meetup, featuring Gilt Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert. Igor will present “Quantifying Loyalty and Anti-Loyalty,” an examination of “the true meaning of customers’ love.” Hope to see you there!
