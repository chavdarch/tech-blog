Great turnout at the decoded fashion and tech hackathon this weekend in NYC. Gilt is one of the many sponsors - and we’re having a really fun time as both judges and mentors.
Amazing to see hundreds of engineers build almost a hundred unique projects to help the fashion world and fashionistas everywhere. http://hack.decodedfashion.com/ #fashionhack
