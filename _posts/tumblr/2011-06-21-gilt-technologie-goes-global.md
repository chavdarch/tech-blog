Gilt Technologie is all about leveraging leading-edge technology to build and operate the most reliable and scalable e-commerce platform in the marketplace.
However, recently, the organization took on a whole new challenge - maximize our ability to attract the very best in talent world-wide by building out a truly distributed, global engineering organization. To fulfill that goal, we’re heavily investing in our two new software development centers located in Portland, Oregon and Dublin, Ireland.
Developing software in a single location is fun and challenging in itself but imagine doing the same with colleagues from around the world - that just adds a whole new dimension to the picture. To jump start this, we''re thinking about creating a week-long “follow-the-sun” Hack-a-thon, where globally distributed teams will work on solutions and innovations that would typically be hard to deliver (in the given timeframe) from a single team within a single timezone.
Getting this just right will definitely be hard to accomplish, but if we do, we’ll end up with a much more scalable organization with incredibly experienced engineers. A win-win for everyone!
Stay tuned to follow our adventure or better yet: Join Gilt to join the fun!!
