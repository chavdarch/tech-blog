AlleyNYC is one of the most active and vibrant co-working spaces in all of NYC, so we’re super-excited that they’ve invited Gilt CTO/Cofounder Michael Bryzek to present at Alley Weekly, their Friday speaker series. The event begins with a fireside chat at noon, followed by a Q&A session and, at 12:50 PM, lunch! Thanks to the AlleyNYC crew and Sam Hysell of Lean Startup Machine for organizing the event.
