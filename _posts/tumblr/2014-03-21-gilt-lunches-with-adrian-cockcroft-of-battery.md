A few weeks ago the Gilt technology team learned via Twitter user Martin that Adrian Cockcroft featured Gilt’s micro-services architecture in his presentation at QCon London. Adrian is the former Chief Architect for High Performance Technical Computing at Sun Microsystems (and author of the best-selling Sun Performance and Tuning book), founding member of eBay Research Labs, former Cloud Architect at Netflix (he helped lead Netflix’s migration to a large scale, highly available public-cloud architecture and the open sourcing of the cloud-native NetflixOSS platform), and current Technology Fellow at Battery Ventures. Adrian was in New York City today and stopped by our office for lunch and a chat with some of our engineers. On the menu: falafel and kebabs from Ali Baba:

We had a fantastic time listening to Adrian talk about his experiences and current work. Thanks to him for taking time out of his busy schedule to visit!
