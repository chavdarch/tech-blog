Movember at GILT.
Here at GILT we care about each other. Therefore, we (those who can) have been growing mustaches for the month of Movember. Why? To support the fight against cancer.
We can all change our faces, by growing mustaches, so let’s change the results of cancer. One in two men and one in three women will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, so let’s change the result of this.
You can make your donation here, http://mobro.co/gilt.
