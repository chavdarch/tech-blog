This past Wednesday, Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs presented a talk at the Brooklyn iOS Developer meetup on how we do mobile testing–and if you couldn’t make it, then check out the slides above! Almost half of the Gilt Mobile team came out to the event to watch/support Matt and hear talks from other companies, including FiftyThree–whose amazing Pencil is something that several of us definitely covet–and CBS Sports. Thanks to meetup organizers Jeff and Stela for inviting us to present!
