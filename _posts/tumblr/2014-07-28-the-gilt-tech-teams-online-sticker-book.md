To get things done, Gilt technologists organize ourselves into small cross-functional teams that work together on specific initiatives. All of our teams pick their own names–Ninjas, Disco, T-Rex, Cerebro, etc.–and some go the extra mile by designing logos and producing swag. Our favorite swag items are stickers: They’re low-cost, easy to reproduce in big batches, and make our laptops look cool.Let’s take a look at some of our sticker creations. First up is the Gilt Tech sticker, our adhesive bread-and-butter:

Based in our Dublin office, Team Nova chose this design because they are always making this hand gesture to celebrate their frequent coding achievements:Also based in our Dublin office, Team Ouroboros focuses on our continuous delivery efforts: development, test tooling, and enabling continuous improvement through voluntary adoption. They are our go-to team for helping with quick iterations and feedback through the build-test-deploy cycle. They also drive our “Developer Happiness KPI”:



Another Ireland Team with a strong branding concept and identity is Team Fire, which works on some of our platform engineering initiatives:

The brand-new Team Twain is working on a top-secret project–so secret, in fact, that their sticker is really the only thing about them that we can share:


Turning to NYC: The Gilt Ninjas are responsible for building our beautiful sales and product pages and many of the other things you see when you visit Gilt.com:


Principal Software Engineer Kevin Scaldeferri and Senior Software Engineer Sean Sullivan both live in Portland and have their own region-specific sticker:


The mighty Gilt Back Office team is one of Gilt’s largest and handles many of our key business operations. They’ve created this appropriately fierce sticker:


Teams within the Back Office Team have begun crafting their own stickers. Team Customer Transactions makes a bold statement with this Soviet-dollar design:


In addition to team stickers, we also make stickers for things we really care about–like LOSA (“Lots of Small Applications”):

Another thing we care about: User Interface Things:

And another thing: we care about great technology! As co-organizers of the Play NYC meetup group, we give out these stickers to all of our new friends and tech event guests:


Celebrating is another important part of Gilt’s tech culture. For their work anniversaries, we give people badges. This is the first-year Gilt-iversary badge:

And the five-year Gilt-iversary:

We’ll add more new sticker designs here as they become available!
