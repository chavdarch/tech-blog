Last summer some of the engineers on Gilt’s Dublin team created and delivered their own full-day, beginners-level Scala course–not just once but twice. The course reviews from our Scala students–all experienced Java programmers–were quite stellar:
“Brilliant course and instructors, very glad to have had the opportunity.” 
Really fantastic venue and team, one of the most enjoyable experiences. Highly recommended.“
The genuine enthusiasm our lecturers had for Scala, programming, teaching and Gilt made things far more interesting, enjoyable and (at times) funny than they might have been without such good people in charge. Their bright attitudes were infectious.”
We’re excited to announce that our Dublin team is ready to bring their brilliant/fantastic/enjoyable Scala class to our NYC office! On Friday, 2/28, two of our esteemed Scalasmiths–Principal Software Engineer Gregor Heine, and Lead Software Engineer John Kenny–will spend a full day teaching all about Scala fundamentals such as:
Classes, traits and objects
Tuples and case classes
Monads
More!
The training day will last from 10 AM to 5 PM with a working lunch. Developers of all programming languages—but especially Java—are invited to participate. Just fill out the form below to submit your contact info, and we’ll let you know if you’ve been selected. (Note: You must be age 18 or older to attend.)Submitting this form does not guarantee you a seat. (Class size is limited to 60 students.) However, it does mean that you’ll receive details about the other courses we’re developing—including advanced Scala and Play—as soon as they become available.
