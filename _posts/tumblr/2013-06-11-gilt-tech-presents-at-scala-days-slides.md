Symmetry is a fundamental feature of math, physics, biology, art, architecture, music and many other things. In “Scala & Symmetry,” Gilt’s Tuesday lunchtime talk at Scala Days, Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman mined for symmetry in Scala, comparing Java and Scala and identifying where the inherent symmetry in Scala leads to much more robust code. Eric also examined the role of asymmetry, and how striking the right balance between asymmetry and symmetry paves the way for writing great code and building great systems.
