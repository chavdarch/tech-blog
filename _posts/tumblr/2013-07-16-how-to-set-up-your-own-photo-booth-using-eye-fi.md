When my sister got married, I wanted to make sure that she had plenty of great photos of her wedding–so I set up a photo booth that captured images and instantly uploaded them to the Internet. Recently I described my setup at 5@4 (née 5@5–Gilt Tech’s ongoing presentation series, featuring five talks at 4 PM every other Friday) and invited Gilt Tech’s photogenic crew, plus our resident dinosaurs, to try it out.




Things got a bit out of hand (as things do, when Tyrannosaurs are involved):

New Internet meme: Dino-Boxing:

Interested in creating your own photo booth? Here’s what you’ll need:
A camera
A computer
Eye-Fi, a wireless photo uploading card, inserted into your camera
Hazel, to automatically organize the files. Download and install it (watch this video for extra help)
Photoshop
Flickr account
Automator
Then follow these steps:Take your picture. Eye-Fi will automatically send the photo from your camera to your computer.
Use Hazel’s rule setup to watch the Eye-Fi folder and run the next step: adding a logo to your photos.
Run your photos through a Photoshop droplet to automatically add the logo to each photo.
Use another Hazel rule to run the Automator workflow, which will send each picture via email to Flickr.
Visit your Flickr account and admire your work.


Run that by me again, please?
