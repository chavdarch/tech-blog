We’re excited to welcome Brendan St. John to the Gilt Tech fold! Brendan works out of our Dublin office and is part of our test architecture team.
Before joining Gilt, Brendan worked on a mobile payments platform; prior to that, he spent time doing test automation and systems administration. In addition to programming in Java, he has experience developing small projects with Ruby and C#. He also knows some Scala–our favorite programming language–after participating in our recent, free Scala course.
Outside of work, Brendan flies paragliders if it’s not rainy or windy. “I learned while I was living in New Zealand and needed a hobby between ski seasons,” he says. “The mountains and climate made it ideal over there, but I still manage to get out a good bit in Ireland, especially with summers like the great one we just had.”
