Tonight the Gilt Data Team hosts the first-ever Looker User Group meetup in NYC! Looker is a data tool that we’re excited about at Gilt–it does a great job of  providing easy access to information, and is helping us to make our data more accessible to everyone company-wide. “Seriously, everyone,” says Gilt Director of Data Engineering Geoff Guerdat. “And it does this while maintaining data definitions, which is important if you’re concerned with all that data governance nerdy stuff.”
Tonight’s meetup begins at 6:30 PM and features presentations by Geoff and reps from Upworthy and Frank & Oak. Looker reps will also be on hand to answer questions and provide a Looker update. Food and drink provided!
