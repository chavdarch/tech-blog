Here’s Gilt Senior Software Engineer Rangarajan Radhakrishnan delivering “Postgres Setup Using Docker,” a brief talk he gave at the NYC PostgreSQL User Group’s meetup last night at Gilt. In addition to Ranga’s talk, the evening included a presentation by meetup co-organizer Jonathan S. Katz on Postgres Indexes, and a major announcement(!): PGConf NYC 2014 will take place Thursday, April 3, 2014 at the New York Marriott Downtown in New York City (YAY!).
Here’s the demo from Ranga’s presentation …
… and the slides are below. BTW: If you’re excited about Docker (we are!) and want to learn more, try to swing by 2 Park on Tues 12/17. That’s when Docker VP of Services James Turnbull visits us to deliver a talk at the Full-Stack Engineering meetup!
