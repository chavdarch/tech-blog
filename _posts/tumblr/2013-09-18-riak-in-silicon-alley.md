Last night Gilt hosted “Riak in Silicon Alley - Why Distributed Databases Should Matter To You,” the September meetup of NYC Riak. This month’s installment featured presentations by Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek, Gilt Lead Software Engineer Jim Englert, Caserta Concepts Principal Consultant Elliott Cordo, and Basho Technologies Tech Evangelist Tom Santero. Here’s Jim giving a more interactive interpretation of his July blog post on our our “Riakathon” in Dublin and Riak’s performance during multiple stress tests. Thanks to NYC Riak for organizing!
