The NYC HTML5 meetup group is one of our favorites to attend, so we’re super-excited that Gilt Lead Software Engineer Eric Shepherd is one of the featured speakers for April! Eric’s talk, “Matrix of Detection,” goes a li’ something like this:

Imagine a three-dimensional space created by X, Y, and Z axes. On the X axis, device detection determines the right quantity of code for the device; on the Y axis, resolution detection responds to the user’s screen size; and on the Z axis, feature detection further tailors the experience to the browser’s capabilities. With users located at points within this three-dimensional matrix, a single application can be served to everyone.

The night’s other featured speakers include Leonard Bogdonoff and Deni Spasovski. The meetup takes place Wednesday, April 16 at Conde Nast’s headquarters. There’s currently a wait list, but a spot might become available so sign up and see what happens!
