This week we (the Dublin team) went to a wine tasting hosted by Cono Sur, one of the biggest producers of Pinot Noir worldwide. One reason why we like Cono Sur is because they feature a bicycle on their labels, and at Gilt we like bicycles.
The highlight of the evening was that our very own Jenny Leahy won the main prize: six bottles of excellent red and white wine.

Here’s Jenny accepting her prize from Chief Winemaker and General Manager of Cono Sur, Adolfo Hurtado. Congrats!
