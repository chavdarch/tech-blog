Yours truly will give a short presentation on the Gilt APIs at Hack Red Hook, which claims to be the first hackathon in Red Hook, Brooklyn! “Our goal is to bring together first-time hackers, of all ages and backgrounds, and experienced developers for 24 hours of learning and creating,” say Hack Red Hook’s organizers. Come by, get a Gilt Tech sticker, and learn about how you can make some extra money by using our APIs!
