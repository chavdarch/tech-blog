Please join #gilttech in welcoming Keith Eng as our new Corporate IT Systems Engineer! Keith will build and optimize our internal corporate infrastructure in NYC. His work will involve designing and implementing our VMware server virtualization environment, Citrix XenApp 6.5 server farm, Digital Asset Management system and NetApp SAN storage arrays, analyzing our systems design and performance, diagnosing server/storage and virtualization issues, and many more essentials. A graduate of Stony Brook University, he’s been a systems engineer for more than seven years. We’re super-excited to have him on our team!
