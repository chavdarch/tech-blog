We are very excited to welcome software engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin to the Gilt tech family, and to the Popeye team (personalization) especially! Originally from Brazil, Giancarlo has a Java background but recently switched to Scala, the language we use at Gilt. His most recent work has focused on creating real-time analytics engines using Storm and Cassandra; with Popeye, he’ll work on pushing forward some of the core functionality that will help us complete our personalized sales revolution.
 Giancarlo’s main interests are distributed systems, Scala and Akka. In his spare time he likes to explore the city with his wife and relax watching movies and TV shows. 
Bem-vindo, Giancarlo!
