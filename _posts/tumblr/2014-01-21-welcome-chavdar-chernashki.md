We’re happy to have Chavdar Chernashki join our team in Dublin! Before joining Gilt, Chavdar worked on a highly scalable notification system based on WebSockets, REST and InfiniSpan. Prior to that he worked at AOL on a real-time bidding technology platform for advertisers. His favorite technologies at the moment are Scala, Closure and Groovy. When it comes to developing software, simplicity is what he strives for and appreciates.  Outside of work, Chavdar stays busy teaching his son “honesty and truthfulness.” He’s grateful for his wife, who “loves and listens. :)”
Welcome, Chavdar!
