Last Friday CoreOS CTO Brandon Philips stopped by Giltâ€™s NYC office to give a short demo and have lunch with some of our engineering team. A few non-Gilt engineers also joined us in learning more about what CoreOS (Linux for massive server deployments") does and how. Thanks to Brandon for interrupting his vacation to join us!
