Last night Gilt hosted the Test Tube: a fun and interactive new event for start-ups and developers to get valuable tips and advice from professional product managers, developers and designers. More than 40 people attended–including Gilt Director of Mobile Product Christopher Gonzalez, Interactive Designer Christopher Barr, and UX Researcher/Taxonomist and featured presenter Amy DeCicco. Crowd size-wise, it was the largest Test Tube to date!
Organized by "Organized by Delve News CTO Tom Weingarten and CouponFollow UX Designer Pierre Wooldridge (in the above photo, they’re the guys in the snazzy lab coats), Test Tube is similar to speed-dating–except that instead of looking (or lookin’) for love, you receive free product feedback. How it works:
bring your wireframes, sketches, and just-baked apps, and one clear task you want the user to achieve
Over the course of an hour-and-a-half, you meet with five or six other start-ups/developers and take turns giving and receiving feedback on each others’ products
You have seven minutes to watch (and listen!) to another start-up interact with your product before the tables turn and you test their product, too
Some photos of last night’s event:

Amy DeCicco starts things off with a brief presentation on how Gilt does usability testing.

Concentration!

After sharing so much feedback, we all fed ourselves on pizza. Thanks to NYC DevShop for supplying wine for the event! 
Test Tube will take place again on 12/17 at the We Work co-working space, but we hope to host it again soon! Our team had a lot of fun, and we all got to meet some very creative and interesting people.
