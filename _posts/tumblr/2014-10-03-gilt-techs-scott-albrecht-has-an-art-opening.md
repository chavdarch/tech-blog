As reported by Boing Boing(!), Gilt Art Director Scott Albrecht is having an art opening tonight at Philadelphia’s Art in the Age gallery. Titled “In The Distance Between Two Points,” the show features new wooden sculptures and hand-drawn typographical art, including the piece above. Scott’s exhibition history includes shows across the North America (all the way to Hawaii, in fact), and his work has been featured in by Juxtapoz, Design Sponge and other prominent art publications. If you’re in Philly tonight, we encourage you to check out his opening!
