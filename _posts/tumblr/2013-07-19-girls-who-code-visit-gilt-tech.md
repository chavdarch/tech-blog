Recently Gilt had the pleasure of hosting a group of young women from Girls Who Code–a nonprofit organization aimed at achieving gender parity in the technology sector. This was the second time we hosted GWC; last year’s delegation voted us as the #1 workplace, so we aimed to live up to our reputation.
We started things off by giving the girls a brief introduction to Gilt Tech, including an overview of our agile development process and a description of the tech team roles. We then divided the group into teams of three and asked each team to design a web page based on the theme, “welcoming Girls Who Code to Gilt.” Some of the girls had HTML experience, others did not, but they all quickly found roles–including project manager, UX designer or coder. They formed mini-versions of our Gilt teams! We were very impressed with their work:


The web page exercise turned out to be a hit–the girls didn’t want to stop working!
The visit ended with a tour of the Gilt office and a question/answer session featuring Gilt women technologists. The girls’ energy was inspiring to see–it’s clear that they are all extremely intelligent, driven and have bright futures ahead of them. We look forward to seeing them again in their careers!
