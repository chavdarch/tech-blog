This week the Gilt team in Dublin, Ireland moved to a new space in Dublin 4. Everyone’s settling in nicely, and we’ve already had a party to celebrate the move!
“As you come through our front door, you are greeted with a large meetup/hangout space and a well-equipped open plan kitchen, perfect for getting everyone together,” says Senior Program Manager Deirdre O''Brien of the new space. “The general office area has a few large open spaces with beanbags and hot desks for teams to regroup.” Here are Principal Software Engineer Gregor Heine and Senior Systems Engineer Anders Holm demonstrating how to “work-lax” in the space:


We’ve separated team areas with glass partitions with integrated “whiteboards” while still retaining much of the vibe that defines #gilttech’s open, communal office culture:


The new office includes four spacious meeting rooms named by Software Engineer/Email team Michal Kowaliszyn: Phoenix, Herbert, Fitzwilliam and Merrion:


We’ve kept the “whiskey shelf” and “green” beer fridge. Big thanks to Gilt Ireland COO Fidelma Healy and IT Services Manager Glenn Conlon for managing the move and creating a fabulous space for Dublin Tech!
