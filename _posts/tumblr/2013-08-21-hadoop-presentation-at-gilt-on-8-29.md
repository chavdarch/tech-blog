On Thu 8/29, Gilt will host the New York Hadoop Users Group’s next meetup at our 2 Park Ave. office. Hortonworks Solutions Engineer Abhijit Lele will present “Developing Applications with Hadoop 2.0 and YARN,” an examination of YARN architecture and how to get started developing for  Hadoop 2.0. YARN is Hadoop’s next-generation resource management framework, and enables Hadoop to grow beyond its MapReduce origins to embrace multiple workloads spanning interactive queries, batch processing, and streaming. 
The event begins at 6 PM. There are only a few seats left, so RSVP ASAP.
