How does Gilt create connections with our millions of customers around the world? What is the difference between “personalization at Gilt” and “Gilt personae”? Who is “the Gilt customer,” and how does the Gilt team identify him and her? And how has Gilt used A/B testing to better serve our customers? Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs will address these and many other questions as the featured speaker of the NJ Tech Meetup’s July 22 event!
As the C-level exec responsible for overseeing Gilt’s technology and product execution and strategy, Steve knows more about our technology infrastructure and day-to-day operations than almost anyone else at the company. If you’ve ever wanted to know more about the philosophy and thought processes behind Gilt’s great product features and offers, you don’t want to miss this talk!
With +3700 members, the NJ Tech Meetup is one of the largest and most active tech meetup groups in the NYC metro area. Tuesday’s event takes place at the Babbio Center at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ and starts at 6:45 PM; just go here to RSVP. Hope to see you there!
