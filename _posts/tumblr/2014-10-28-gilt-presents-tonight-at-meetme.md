Gilt Principal Engineer Michael Hansen travels to New Hope, PA tonight to talk about how Gilt manages real-time (or near real-time) data capturing with Kafka, Avro and HDFS. New Hope is the hometown of MeetMe, “the leading social network for meeting new people in the US and the public market leader for social discovery.” Michael’s a guest of Bucks County Tech, a meetup group for developers. RSVP here to attend!
