Kevin Ryan, a co-founder and the chairman of Gilt, is also a founder of MongoDB, the amazing NoSQL database used by Gilt and so many other companies. On June 18, the two sibling-companies join forces to provide the Dublin tech community with a free, full-day workshop in MongoDB!
Aimed at technologists who are familiar with using MongoDB but who wish to learn the secrets of highly successful MongoDB projects, this interactive course–taught by MongoDB Senior Solutions Architect John Page–will challenge your ideas of how and where MongoDB can be used. It will cover:
Strategies for scaling and building high-performance, highly available systems
How to perform real-time analytics

Finally, the course will supply the answers to tricky questions about joins and transactions.
