#gilttech is proud to be one of the first tech teams to participate in Uncubed’s brand-new Uncubed Edge online learning platform. Uncubed recently visited our Manhattan office to film sessions with Special Operations Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek–who presents a one-hour talk on “How Gilt.com became Responsive and Adaptive”–and Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert, who shares “How Gilt Saves Hundreds of Hours with MetaSQL.”

Uncubed charges a nominal fee to watch the courses–go here to check them out, then let us know what you think by pinging us on Twitter.
