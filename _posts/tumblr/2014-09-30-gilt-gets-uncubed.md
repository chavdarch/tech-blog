Last Friday a video crew from Uncubed trekked to our NYC office to shoot a suite of three one-hour learning sessions with Gilt Special Operations Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek and Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert. Here’s a snapshot of one of the afternoon’s Hollywood-y moments. Greg and Igor’s video presentations go public this Friday–we’re excited to see the results! Thanks to the Uncubed team for inviting us to be a part of this great online learning initiative!
