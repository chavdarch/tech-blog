Please welcome Kevin Schultz, the newest member of Gilt’s mobile team! Kevin will focus on Android and will push our update to release.
In a past life Kevin worked with fellow Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs (Mobile) and Lead Software Engineer Brian Ballantine (Personalization), which suggests that some sort of colonization is taking place (no complaints–they’re all amazing!). He’s also been a mechanical engineer and worked on nuclear submarines, but he can’t tell you about it or else he will have to kill you. He also enjoys sailing, surfing, and snowboarding. Most importantly he likes Android. Here he is at Monday’s Scalapalooza, contemplating a table decked out with dozens of Num Pang sandwiches. Welcome, Kevin! (Photo by Nancy Borowick)
