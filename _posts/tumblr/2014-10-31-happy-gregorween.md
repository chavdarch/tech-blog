The #gilttech team enjoys having fun in unusual ways, so this week our Dublin and NYC offices jointly “disrupted” Halloween by holding our first-ever Gregorween party. Gregorween honored Principal Software Engineer Gregor Heine (Dublin), Special Operations Lead Software Engineer Greg Mazurek (NYC), and Software Engineer Greg Perez (NYC). Each Greg has his own style to emulate–and emulate we did!
Here’s our Dublin office:

And:

Counted:
Four Gregor Heines
Three Greg Mazureks
Zero Greg Perez’s
Turning to NYC:

Tally:
Two Gregor Heines
Four Greg Mazureks
Two Greg Perez’s

Uh, make that three Gregor Heines in NYC, if you count Brushes the Giraffe’s half-hearted effort (no metal shirt).
This isn’t the first time we’ve created a holiday for someone on the #gilttech team (none of us will ever forget “Dress Like Nathan Day”). So if you take away a message from this otherwise self-indulgent post, it’s that making up holidays for your coworkers is a fun (if a bit strange) way to celebrate their talents, skills and other contributions to your team culture!
