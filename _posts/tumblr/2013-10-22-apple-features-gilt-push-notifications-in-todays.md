Earlier today, Apple’s Craig Federighi presented a demo of Safari’s new push notification system that featured the implementation we put together at www.gilt.com/sale/women. You can watch the special event online here (catch the Gilt references at the 18:30 mark), or you can glance at the screenshots below.
The Mavericks operating system will allow us to send members push notifications to their desktops/laptops on Safari. Like our iPhone/iPad push notifications, this is a great way for us to communicate time-sensitive information to our members about the moment sales start and wait list item availability. And with the iCloud Keychain functionality, members’ usernames, passwords and credit card info will be synched up across their devices and stored securely in iCloud for even faster and easier check-out than before.
When you navigate to www.gilt.com/sale/women on Safari Mavericks, you will see a prompt at the top of the page that asks you if you’d like to turn on push messaging:






After you subscribe, you’ll receive messages from Gilt whenever we have something urgent to tell you. This is what Craig saw during his demo:

If you click on the message, you will be taken to the relevant Gilt page:

And once you decide to buy that tent, Mavericks will sync your login information across all of your devices:

And when you get to the checkout screen, Mavericks will also help you manage your credit card information:

We’d like to thank Apple for featuring Gilt during its demo, and all of the Gilt team members who helped get this ready for Apple’s presentation. Although it’s only been a few hours since the launch of this new feature, quite a few people have already signed up. And because Mavericks is now free (!), why not download it and sign up for our desktop push notifications!?
