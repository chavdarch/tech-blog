Gilt is one of more than 400 tech companies exhibiting at this year’s NYC TechDay–a start-up science fair at Pier 92 that TechDay organizers claim is “the world’s largest start-up event.” This year more than 11,000 people RSVPed to attend–and we want to meet them all!
Registration is free, so if you live anywhere near New York City go ahead and sign up here. A delegation from Gilt’s Tech team–including half the mobile team from 3 to 5 PM–will be hanging out at our booth to answer your questions, hand out swag and play board games with our guests. All the fun begins at 9 AM and runs through 5:30 PM.
Here’s a video from last year’s TechDay:
