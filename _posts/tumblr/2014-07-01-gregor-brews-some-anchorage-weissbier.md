Gilt Principal Software Engineer Gregor Heine added a frothy finishing touch to last week’s 5@4 in Dublin by brewing up a batch of his homemade ale for the team. Gregor gave a brief “Intro to Homebrewing” course (to be cont’d in future 5@4s) and included a live demo as part of his instruction. Now the Dublin team has to wait two weeks to sample his work!
