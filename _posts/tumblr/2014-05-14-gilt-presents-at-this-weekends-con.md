A few months ago the #gilttech team was excited to learn about !!Con: a brand-new, two-day tech conference focused on what’s exciting about programming. Now we’re even more excited to announce that one of our own, Gilt City Software Engineer Jennifer Shin, is presenting! With “High Schoolers vs. Robots!!!!,” Jennifer will focus on what she learned during our recent visit with students from the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering.
Jennifer presents her 10-minute talk on Saturday at 1:45 PM; the full conference speaker roster schedule is here.
