Action Shot: A group of Gilt software engineers gathered ‘roun the television this afternoon to watch Typesafe’s “Introducing Slick 2.0.0” webinar. We’re considering using Slick in one of our new projects and found the webinar really helpful–especially the use cases that Slick tech lead/instructor Stefan Zeiger provided.
“Stefan provides an example of a fairly complicated for-comprehension using Slick, and his slides make what is happening under the sugar easy to understand,” says Myyk Seok, an engineer on our back office team. “The talk left me confident that I would be able to leave Squeryl/Anorm and write my next service with Slick instead.”
