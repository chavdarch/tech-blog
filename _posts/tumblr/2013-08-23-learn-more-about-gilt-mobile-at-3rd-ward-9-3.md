If you happen to be in NYC on September 3 (it’s a Tuesday), take the L train to Brooklyn and catch the Brooklyn Design & Technology (BKTK) meetup group’s fireside chat featuring Gilt. VP of Product Management Dominique Essig and VP of Mobile and Global Engineering Yonatan Feldman will have a lively and insightful conversation about recent innovations in eCommerce and Gilt’s mobile strategy. After their chat, a Q&A session will follow. The event takes place at the popular learning/events/cultural space 3rd Ward and starts at 7 PM. To RSVP, just go here.
