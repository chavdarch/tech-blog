Yesterday Jeremy Ashkenas came by Gilt to talk about CoffeeScript, a language he’s been working on since 2009. CoffeeScript is a simple language with syntactic roots in Python and Ruby. It compiles into JavaScript and adds interesting features including array comprehensions. CoffeeScript is arguably more readable than JavaScript.
Jeremy gave a great overview of CoffeeScript and who is using it. He gets into detail on the Syntax of the language and also discusses its implementation and how to go about creating your own language.
