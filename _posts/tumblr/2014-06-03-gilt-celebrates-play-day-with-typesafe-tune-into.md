Today Typesafe celebrates its first-annual Play Day with a full day of webinars–and #gilttech is honored to be a part of the activities! The sessions kick off at 9 AM PST with Adam Evans, Technical Lead for BBC Children’s Future Media, “Making The Case For Play,” and run through 5:45 PM PST with Typesafe Lead Developer James Roper on “Reactive Streams and Play 3.0.”
The Play Day module we’re most excited about (we’re a little biased :) ) comes at 2 PM PST, when Gilt Senior Software Engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin (Personalization Team) shares “Lessons Learned From Implementing Play Across Lots of Small Applications and Microservices.” Details on Giancarlo’s presentation:

This session will focus on Gilt’s implementation of Play Framework across its architecture–starting with Gilt Live, a real-time page showcasing purchases made in real-time, and eventually branching out to many critical parts of the company’s tech organization (from search to inventory status updates). Play has offered Gilt numerous advantages in terms of accessibility, scalability and performance. You’ll hear more about lessons learned and the many advantages Play has offered to Gilt, a rapidly-moving eCommerce company with more than eight million users.

Hundreds of people have already signed up for Giancarlo’s webinar–and you should, too! To register, just go here.
