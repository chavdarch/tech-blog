If you just can’t wait until April 4 to spend the day learning Hadoop with us for free, here’s some good news: You can spend the day with us a week earlier! On Thursday, March 27, GitHub trainer Peter Bell stops by 2 Park Avenue to help us all work with Git and GitHub more effectively. In this fast-paced, full-day course, we’ll dig into:
configuration
three-stage thinking
renaming and deleting files
effectively using .gitignores
feature branching strategies
effective collaboration using GitHub (clones, single repo collaboration, forking and pull requests)
using tags and branches for releases
how to undo almost everything with revert, commit —amend, reset, rebus -i and the reflog
When: Thursday, March 27, 2014 from 10 AM to 5 PMWhere: Gilt, 2 Park Avenue, New York City, NYCost: FREE (includes breakfast and lunch)Who: Gilt technologists, maybe you?
