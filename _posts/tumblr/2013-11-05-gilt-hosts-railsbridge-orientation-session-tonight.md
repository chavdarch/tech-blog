Tonight Gilt hosts the volunteer orientation of the NYC chapter of RailsBridge, an organization that hosts free weekend Ruby on Rails workshops for women. Volunteers will help organize and produce RailsBridge NYC’s workshop at General Assembly this weekend (November 8 and 9); to register, click this link.
Founded by San Francisco technologists Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen in 2009, RailsBridge now boasts chapters around the world. In addition to Rails, the group offers and promotes free courses in CSS and HTML in order to make tech more diverse and welcoming to groups underrepresented in technology. To learn more about RailsBridge’s origins, check out Sarah Allen’s slide deck.
