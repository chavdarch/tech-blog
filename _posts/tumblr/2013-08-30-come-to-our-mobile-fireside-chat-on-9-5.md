Maybe you can’t make it to Brooklyn on 9/3 for our mobile-centric fireside chat because you’re avoiding the L train (the grey signage puts you in a melancholy mood), or because you’re having a post-Labor Day party, or because you don’t live in North America. No worries: On Thu 9/5, come to Manhattan office for the NY Mobile Startups meetup group’s fireside chat featuring Gilt Director of Mobile Product Management Christopher Gonzalez and several other members of our mobile team! To RSVP, just go here. The evening begins at 6:30 PM and concludes at 8:30 PM.
This info won’t benefit all of you who actually do live on other continents, though if you do end up flying in just for the fireside chat we’ll make sure to give you a Gilt Tech T-shirt for your efforts.
