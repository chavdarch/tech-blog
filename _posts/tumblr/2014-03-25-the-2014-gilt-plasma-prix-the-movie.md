Last month we told you about the Gilt Plasma Prix: a race pitting our ten fastest PlasmaCar racers from NYC and Dublin against each other in a bid for glory, fame, and modestly sized trophies. Hereâ€™s the official epic documentary! Thanks to videographer Christi Clifford for capturing all the thrills and excitement of the event.


We also created a Plasma Prix photo set: just go here to look.
