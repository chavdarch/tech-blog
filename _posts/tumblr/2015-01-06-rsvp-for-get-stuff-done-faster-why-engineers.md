Our first tech meetup of 2015 is all about making engineers’ lives better. On Thursday, January 15, Gilt Director of Program Management Justin Riservato, Director of Product Andrew Chen, Senior Business Systems Manager Susan Thomas, and Senior Program Manager Myron Miller will present “Get Stuff Done Faster: Why Engineers Should Work with the “Dark Side” of Tech- a talk that focuses on the difference between Program Managers, Business Analysts and Product Managers, and why you engineers need all these managers on your team. These industry professionals will demonstrate how they make Gilt engineers’ work lives easier and more fulfilling. By the end of the night, you’ll be planning to ask for more managers for your team (seriously)!
Go here to RSVP and join us for networking, learning, trading awkward Star Wars references, and post-panel Q&A’ing. Pizza and beverages will be provided. Leave your lightsabers at home, please.
