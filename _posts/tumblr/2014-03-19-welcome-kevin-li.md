We’re excited to welcome Software Engineer Kevin Li to Gilt’s growing team of technologists! Kevin joins our Loyalty team, which works on our acclaimed Gilt Insider program and related initiatives. Kevin joined us on Monday and has already made a bug fix and had a production deployment!
Originally from King of Prussia, Pa., Kevin has spent the past two years living in Norwalk, Conn. and working at a financial software company. Before that, he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. When he’s not coding, you can find him snowboarding, working on personal embedded projects/hardware, or just hanging out with his friends. “If you ask me to go to a happy hour or try out a new restaurant, I’m always down,” he says.
