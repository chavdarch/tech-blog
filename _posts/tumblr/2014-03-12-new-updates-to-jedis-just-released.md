Gilt Principal Systems Engineer Jonathan Leibiusky (aka Xetorthio) is amazingly prolific when it comes to releasing useful open source projects–including Jedis, the popular, easy-to-use Redis Java client. Today Jon released Jedis 2.4.2–a new version that includes improvements to JedisCluster’s connection handling and JedisCluster multi-threading. Check it out!
(In related: Jon is also the co-author (with Chanwit Kaewkasi) of Gedis, a Redis client for Groovy.)
