Our Data team held their very first Looker hackathon and kicked off what promises to be an exciting year-long project that will impact many different Gilt departments. Lead engineers and analysts from Looker came to our NYC office to help us throughout the day. “We started work and expanded on over 10 new data models in the tool,” says Gilt Business Intelligence Engineer George Chien. “We also identified several new enhancements that we’ve suggested to Looker. Our team will be instrumental in shaping the tool’s development roadmap.” That’s Director of Data Engineering Geoff Guerdat at the screen, leading the way. 
To learn more about Looker at Gilt (and to see what Geoff looks like with a wooly wintertime beard), check out this brief slideshow from our February meetup with the Looker User Group.
