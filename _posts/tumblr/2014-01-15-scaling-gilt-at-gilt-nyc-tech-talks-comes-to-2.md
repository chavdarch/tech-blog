The crowd from last night’s NYC Tech Talks event at Gilt–not an empty seat in the house!
Last night a standing-room only (!) crowd of software engineers, CTOs and other technologists came to our Manhattan office to catch “Scaling Gilt: From Monolithic Ruby App to Distributed Scala Micro-Services,” a tech talk by our very own Yoni Goldberg. Yoni, a lead software engineer on our personalization team, gave a lively presentation that highlighted the reasons why we’ve adopted a micro-services architecture, the lessons we’ve learned along the way, and a few key questions every tech team should ask before developing a micro-services architecture of their own.
Check out Yoni’s slides here:
 
Yoni’s presentation was co-hosted by Gilt Tech and NYC Tech Talks, one of NYC’s top meetup groups for engineers. In addition to a fantastic crowd of tech professionals from Gilt, Facebook, Etsy, LinkedIn and other top companies, the night featured delicious food, post-presentation drinks and mingling, and lots of great conversations.
Here’s a photo-recap of the night’s fun:

This way to the meetup!

For dinner we ordered an assortment of scrumptious sandwiches from Num Pang, who–a few hours before the meetup–tweeted a preview pic at us along with a note: “Excited to cater #NYCTechTalks at Gilt tonight!” (We were even more excited to eat their food.)

Plenty of beer for plenty of software engineers!

Early arrivals hung out in our cafe.

NYC Tech Talks co-organizer Mike Brittain officially kicked off the evening by welcoming the audience. 

Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs followed with a brief introduction to Gilt and Gilt’s tech culture before introducing Yoni.

Yoni gives the audience a general overview of our MSA–450 micro-services and counting!

The audience listens attentively to Yoni’s talk.
As part of his presentation, Yoni created Podium: a Node.js app that enabled attendees to submit questions in advance of the meetup and vote for their favorites. A sampling of submissions: 


More questions for Yoni!
