On Thu 10/10, Gilt Senior Business Systems Manager Susan Thomas will present “Bridging the Communication Gap Between Product Managers & Stakeholders,” an exploration of the communications strategies we use at Gilt to get things done. In her talk, Susan will cover these and other topics:
why tech leads are critical to a growing organization
how to effectively work with an engineering team to design service architecture around business needs
the importance of remaining transparent and honest with product and project stakeholders
how saying “no” can lead to efficient, successful development processes
managing expectations and preserving communication channels in a constantly shifting business landscape
Susan’s talk–the third and final installment in “Built to Scale,” a Gilt-centric series organized by the NY Tech Council– follows presentations by Gilt VP Personalization Erik Lumer and co-founder/CTO Michael Bryzek. You can RSVP here.
