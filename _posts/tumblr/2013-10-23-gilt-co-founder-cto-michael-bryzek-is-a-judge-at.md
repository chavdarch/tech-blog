Tonight Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek will be judging Products and Services business ideas for the $100K Pitch Contest, part of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition. For the Pitch, MIT students and researchers have 60 seconds to deliver their business proposals to a panel of judges, who then offer instant feedback. Michael (an MIT alum) and the other panelists will judge contestants based on the viability of their business plans and their pitch presentations. Good luck to all the participants!
This is the 24th year of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, which also includes Accelerate (product demonstrations) and Launch (developing business plans to launch new start-ups). This yearâ€™s prizes amount to $350,000.
