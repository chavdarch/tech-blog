One Friday morning in early February, the lives of many a Gilt technologist changed forever when a PlasmaCar showed up in our 2 Park office. Since that fateful Friday, a whole culture of PlasmaCar racing and competition has sprung up in both our NYC and Dublin offices–with official racing courses, official regulations, and official scoreboard, and official timekeepers (they wear silvery “marshal” badges). The friendly folks at PlasmaCar HQ heard about our activities and have helped us grow our fleet from one to five PlasmaCars. Man and woman, short and tall (as well as super-tall–like, 6''8" tall), adult and child-like adult, junior software engineer and Apache project committer, tech exec and whole-company exec: all of the above have been spotted (sometimes after hours) riding around, Plasma-style.
“PC Fever” has also spread to other Gilt departments–here are Tyler Thoreson (VP, Men’s & Home Editorial, Creative & Customer Experience) and Tracy Lomerantz Lester (Editorial Director, Women’s & Kid’s) helping to make our PlasmaCars famous:
