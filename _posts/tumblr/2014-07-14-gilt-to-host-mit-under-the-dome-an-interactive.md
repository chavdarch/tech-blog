#gilttech is excited and honored to host a talk by W. Eric L. Grimson PhD, the Chancellor for Academic Advancement at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology! On Thursday, July 17, we will present “MIT: Under the Dome,” an interactive discussion with Chancellor Grimson that will include a brief history of MIT and the breadth of the Institute’s impact around the world. Chancellor Grimson will also address MIT’s intention to liberate human potential for innovation, on campus and worldwide. 
In addition to being an MIT faculty member since 1984 and a past chancellor (2011-2013), Chancellor Grimson has also served as Head of MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (2005-2011) and is a member of the school’s Computer Vision Group (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory), among other distinctions. He championed MITx and the formation of the Office of Digital Learning; teaches 6.00x, one of the first MITx courses, to more than 200,000 registrants; and has served as thesis supervisor to approximately 50 MIT PhDs. 
Whether you’re a software engineer, a computer science student or just curious about the latest innovations underway at one of the world’s most elite academic institutions, this event will be a don’t-miss! Gilt’s NYC office will host the event; doors open at 6:30 PM. To RSVP, just go here.
