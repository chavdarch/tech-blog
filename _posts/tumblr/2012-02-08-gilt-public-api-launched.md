I’m really excited to tell you that we’ve launched our Public API today, providing programmatic access to a constantly-updating collection of flash sales full of the usual kind of awesome stuff we offer on Gilt’s stores.

We held an internal hackathon two weeks ago and saw some really interesting projects come out of just a day’s work and the brainpower of one room of (admittedly super-smart and obviously very handsome) Gilt engineers, but I can only imagine where things can go now that we’ve got the whole developer community armed and ready.

If you’re not like me and don’t just get pumped up whenever you see a new API you can curl, maybe I can sweeten the deal a bit— we’re in the process of putting the finishing touches on an affiliate marketing program, meaning that you can earn a cut of any money we make when your app leads to a purchase on Gilt. You can start building your project now and we’ll have the details on how to sign up and integrate this into your work soon.

The Gilt Developer Portal is your go-to site to read up on how to use our API and apply for API keys for your applications. We’ll be adding more information to that site regularly as we add new features and content to the Public API. Exposing sales and products is just a first step; we’ve got a lot of exciting ideas in the works, so stay tuned!
