That’s Gilt Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert smiling at far right, and Gilt Data Team members Roger Huang, Anna Szostek and Michael Hansen sitting in the front row. Igor was one of the panelists at last night’s “Smart Data & Market Intelligence” event put on by Fashion 2.0.
In the coming weeks we can expect to see some musical chairs-ing among this team: Roger’s presenting on clickstream data at Gilt at the UX + Data meetup group’s June 11 event, and Michael’s speaking on June 18 at the Princeton Tech meetup!
