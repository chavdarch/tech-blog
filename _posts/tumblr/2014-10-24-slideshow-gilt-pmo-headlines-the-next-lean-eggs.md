 The Agile PMO (fall 2014 version)  from Gilt Tech Talks
They’ve spoken at the Atlassian Summit, at Pace University, and several other prestigious venues, and now they’re headlining Neo’s monthly “Lean Eggs & Ham” breakfast series … they’re Flemivato! Er, that would be Gilt Senior Director, Program Management Office Heather Fleming and Director of Program Management Justin Riservato to you. On Tuesday morning at Neo’s NYC office, Heather and Justin will discuss how they manage Gilt’s engineering and product development teams through their special brand of Agile. Sadly, if you haven’t already RSVPed then you can’t attend – the talk is sold-out! But you can savor the above slideshow that covers much of the content that Heather and Justin will present on Tuesday.
