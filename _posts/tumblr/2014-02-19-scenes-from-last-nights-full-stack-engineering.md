Last night the Full-Stack Engineering meetup came back to Gilt–and what a meetup it was! More than 130 people came out to hear Gilt front-end engineer Nathan Stilwell, Greenhouse.io Director of Engineering/Full-Stack organizer Mike Boufford, and Vimeo Video Systems Engineer Dieter Plaetinck talk about WebSockets, JavaScript, and GraphExplorer. Some scenes of the action:

Nathan explains how Gilt’s engineering team has used WebSockets to create real-time applications that require full duplex communication. He also gave an overview of SocketWrench, his open-source wrapper around native WebSockets that offers more flexibility than the official WebSocket API. View Nathan’s full presentation here.

Thanks to all of our speakers and guests for making it such a fun and energetic meetup!
