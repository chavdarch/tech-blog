Last night Gilt hosted our first-ever iOS Office Hours in collaboration with Code Coalition. At least 60 people came out to our 2 Park Ave. office to network, code and catch short talks by Gilt Principal Software Engineer Evan Maloney (seen here discussing mobile strategy), Code Coalition’s Teddy Wyly, Eliot Arntz, and John Nichols, Matt Parker of WurkHappy, and developer Venkat Rao. Thanks to Code Coalition and to everyone who came out to join us!
If you’d like to attend our next iOS Office Hours on Wed 8/28, just RSVP here. Interested in giving a short talk? Send your ideas via the Meetup “Contact” form. 


Matt Parker of WurkHappy presents his talk, “Phonegap: What Is It Good For?”
