Here’s a shot of our standing-room-only crowd (until we retrieved a few dozen more chairs from around the office, that is) from our Responsive Web Design meetup earlier this week. Gilt Special Operations team Gregory Mazurek (lead software engineer/vocals) and Kyle Dorman (software engineer/lead guitar) and Jose Sanchez (software engineer/drums) told the crowd of software engineers, creative directors, UX designers and other folks about how we made Gilt.com responsive to the mobile device.
We’ve had a lot of requests for the slides from Special Ops’ talk–you can find them right here. Trick or treat!
