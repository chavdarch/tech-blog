This week Dublin’s played host to the Web Summit: a two-day conference featuring CEOs, investors, developers and other professionals from the world’s most innovative and recognized tech companies. Today Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman was a featured speaker on the Developers Stage, the Summit’s dedicated venue for engineers and tech execs. Titled “Continuous Innovation at Gilt,” Eric’s talk focused on the parallels between the values driving the Gilt tech culture (autonomy, decentralization) and our approaches to using and developing technology (lots of micro-services, creating a deployment platform that emphasizes flexibility and allows for safely taking risks).
