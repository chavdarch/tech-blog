Earlier this summer our friends at Sauce Labs released Appium 1.0, which the Gilt Mobile team has been using to automate our mobile testing efforts. Not long after its release, Gilt Senior Software Engineer Matt Isaacs wrote a blog post for for Sauce Labs highlighting Appium’s advantages and where it still falls a bit short. Yesterday (August 20) Matt joined representatives from Sharecare, Softcrylic and other Appium-using companies at Sauce Labs’ all-day Appium Roadshow at Projective Space in the Lower East Side. 
For all of you who couldn’t make it to yesterday’s sold-out event, here are Matt’s slides:
