If you’re a NYC-area Scalasmith who can’t attend our July 3 Scala libraries course because you’re starting your patriotic gardenburger-grilling a day early, here’s another opportunity to learn Scala things at Gilt for free: On July 14, we’re hosting a free sbt workshop with Typesafe Senior Software Engineer Josh Suereth! Josh, the author of sbt in Action, will give an introduction to sbt and show how it can make your development flow better. The talk will be accessible to people who have not used Scala or sbt extensively, but will also include useful examples and tips for seasoned sbt users. 
When: Monday, July 14, 2014 from 6-9 PMWhere: 2 Park Avenue, New York, NYCost: FREE (includes dinner)Who: Gilt technologists, maybe you too
