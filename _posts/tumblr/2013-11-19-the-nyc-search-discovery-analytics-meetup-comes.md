Last night Gilt had the privilege of hosting the NYC Search, Discovery & Analytics meetup group at our Park Avenue office. As an eCommerce company that offers our members thousands of products to choose from every day, search is very important to us; after all, we want to make sure that our members find what they’re looking for, and quickly. We were excited to share our enthusiasm for search with the many meetup members in attendance, and now we’re excited to share some photos of the event with you!

These pizzas were all gone by the end of the evening …

Guests mix and mingle before the presentations begin. 

Gilt City engineer Michael Reed chats with guest Uzodimma Chiapa… 

… while Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek chats with Gilt City engineer Artie Motamed, Gilt/University of Waterloo co-op intern Michael Vecchio, and guest Jonathan Potter.

Michael Bryzek kicks off the presentations with a brief talk about search at Gilt.

Meetup organizer Otis Gospodnetić­ introduces the night’s featured speaker: Sematext Software Engineer Radu Gheorghe, who told us all about Elasticsearch and even gave a demo!

We closed the evening with a brief Q&A session.
Thanks to Otis, Radu, and everyone else who attended the meetup! We look forward to seeing everyone again at 2 Park.
