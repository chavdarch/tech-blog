Gilt gives a hearty welcome to Christopher Poenaru, who joins Team Popeye (personalization) for the summer! Chris comes to us through the co-op program at Canada’s prestigious University of Waterloo, where he is a third-year student. He’s passionate about new technologies and loves trying his hand with new languages and frameworks.
When he’s not in front of the computer, Chris loves to travel and try new things. Like many a Gilt technologist he’s an avid cyclist and runner, and enjoys competing in triathlons. It’s his first time living in NYC, but not his first experience living abroad: he spent just shy of a decadeliving as a TCK in Kenya. We’re grateful to have him join us!
