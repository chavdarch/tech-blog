Gilt is super-excited to welcome Michael Palma to our software engineering team! Formerly known as “The Intern”–he spent fall/winter 2013 with us through the University of Waterloo co-op program–Michael is now known around the office as “The Employee.” Here is what he has to say about himself:


“I’m a recent Computer Engineering graduate, originally from Toronto. I am extremely passionate about my job here at Gilt and have fallen in love with the beautiful city of New York. I am a big fan of cooking, video games, and–of course–grabbing drinks with a few friends. I really am looking forward to the challenges I face as a Software Engineer at Gilt!

Glad to have you back, Employee!
