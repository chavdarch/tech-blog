The Product Council’s Sept. 25 event features our very own VP Product Dominique Essig!
productcouncil:

Grab tickets here before they’re gone: http://productcouncilnyc-sept.eventbrite.com/- - - Our Mission:
We provide startups a new space for critical feedback, ideation, and improvement of their products. Each month an audience of product managers, designers, and founders gather to learn valuable lessons and insights from experienced product owners as they dive deep into the challenge, success and failure of product design. This is no demo or pitch, rather it’s an open examination of how you execute an idea. 
That… and we always have plenty of beer and good snacks!
