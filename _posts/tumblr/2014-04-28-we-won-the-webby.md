Today Gilt learned that our iPhone app won this year’s Webby Award in the best iPhone app, shopping (handheld devices) category! Organized by the International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences, the Webbys are “the Oscars of the Internet,” with more than 12,000 applicants participating in this year’s overall competition. Congrats to everyone on the Gilt team–especially our talented mobile engineers–for achieving this honor!
