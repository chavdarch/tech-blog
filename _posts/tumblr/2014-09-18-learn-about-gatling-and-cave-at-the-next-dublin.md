The Gilt team is excited to host the next Dublin Scala Users Group event at our awesome new office in Dublin 4! Here’s what is on the menu:
Happy Performance Testing–DSLing Your System with Gatling: In this talk, Citi Lead Mobile Architect Aman Kohli and Citi Software Engineer Kevin Yu Wei Xia will present their experiences using Gatling, a load-testing framework written in Scala. The power of Gatling is the DSL it provides to allow writing meaningful and expressive tests. Aman and Kevin will provide an overview of the framework, a description of their development environment and goals, and present their test results.
CAVE: An Overview:  Gilt Senior Software Engineer Val Dumitrescu will provide an overview of CAVE: Gilt’s open-source, managed service for monitoring infrastructure, platform, and application metrics that provide visibility into your system’s performance and operational levels. CAVE is built with Scala, Play and Akka.
The meetup takes place on September 23 at 7 PM; go here to RSVP.
