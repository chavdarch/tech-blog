More than 150 software engineers came to watch Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg debut his “Scaling Gilt” talk in January 2014. More than 11,400 people have checked out the slides from Yoni’s presentation. Many more developers caught him give the talk at LambdaConf. And now you can watch video of Yoni delivering the most recent version of his super-popular presentation here on InfoQ’s website. The video dates to Yoni’s appearance at this summer’s QCon New York (Gilt cofounder and CTO Michael Bryzek was also a QCon presenter).
Is this a Scala-centric Halloween treat, or what? Enjoy, everyone!
