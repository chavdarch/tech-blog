Gilt Tech is proud to inform you that Gilt CIO Steve Jacobs is one of only 19 NYC-area senior executives chosen to participate in this yearâ€™s David Rockefeller Fellows program! Created in 1989 by the Partnership for New York City, a membership organization made up of CEOs from 200 leading businesses headquartered in New York, the Rockefeller Fellows program enables participants to learn more about current civic issues and meet the governmental, business and nonprofit leaders in charge of addressing those issues. Participants also get to tour important landmarks such as NYC courts and jails, transportation centers, and commercial hubs. Steve joins execs from Nickelodeon, Xerox, Citigroup and Time Warner; check the full list here.
