Next Tuesday–that’s February 25 (hooray, winter is almost OVER)–Gilt Lead Engineer (and resident coffee-roasting expert) Gregory Mazurek will give a talk targeted to all of you front-end engineers and mobile devs. Titled “Gilt Mobile Web, and Web-Components,” Greg’s talk covers some of the key decisions his team has made in designing the Gilt mobile web experience, and how the results relate to the full-web Gilt experience. Greg will also discuss his thoughts on the Card UI pattern and introduce the audience to web-components: the latter a collection of standards that, Greg believes, will help engineers and designers create better user experiences on both the mobile web and full-screen.
Greg’s talk takes place at Gilt’s NYC office (2 Park Avenue). The frontend-friendly NYC CSS/UX meetup group cohosts. Yes, there will be pizza and beer (would we let you starve? No, we wouldn’t).
