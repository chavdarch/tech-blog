Gilt Senior Software Engineer Lukasz Szwed, who’s based at our Dublin office, will be flying eastward soon to present at the Krakow Scala Users Group’s upcoming ScalaCamp meetup. As ScalaCamp’s featured presenter, Lukasz will talk about Gilt’s development and deployment infrastructure in continuous-innovation mode with Scala, and also describe the evolution of our architecture from a monolithic Rails application to a constellation of more than 300 microservices written in Scala. As Lukasz notes in his abstract, “we’re able to provide more value to our customers and adapt to changes more effectively when our developers can focus on coding and testing, and not on other tasks that can be automated instead.”
In addition to Lukasz’s talk, ScalaCamp will feature a presentation by AGH researcher and independent software consultant Marcin Jarząb on Apache Kafka. The event will close with networking and a pub visit. Sounds like fun! ScalaCamp takes place Thursday, November 28 (5:30 PM) at Katedra Informatyki AGH, Building D-17 in Krakow. RSVP here!
