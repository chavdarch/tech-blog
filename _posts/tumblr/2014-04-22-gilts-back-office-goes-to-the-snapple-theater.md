This Thursday (April 24) Gilt Director of Back Office Systems Christopher Hazlett will appear at NYC’s Snapple Theater for “Business Dilemma: Effective Tech Team Management,” an event organized by the New York City Web Development Community meetup. Tailored to the interests of business owners, project managers, developers, and other stakeholders, the night’s presentations are meant to help the audience “bridge the disconnect that exists between management and tech people.” Titled “Say No…For the Greater Good,” Christopher’s talk will highlight how saying no has helped the Back Office team prioritize tasks, successfully achieve its goals and collaborate with a diverse array of stakeholders. Doors open at 6PM; RSVP here to attend!
