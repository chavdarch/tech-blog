The things you learn from Facebook about your co-workers: Yesterday some of us Gilt techsters discovered that our colleague, Miguel Angel Fajardo–a lead software engineer on our back office team–is a published author! In 2010, Miguel wrote Las Aventuras de Sela, a Spanish-language, illustrated book for kids ages seven to 12. Sela (also available in eBook format) tells the tale of a seal who must relocate after pollution makes her home uninhabitable. On her quest for new digs, she gets lost for a spell but ends up making some new friends. Eventually she finds clean water and a new home.
Miguel derived inspiration for the book during a trip to Dublin (serendipitous foreshadowing); while walking the city, he spotted some seals sitting on a dock and got the idea for Sela. Writing the book took several months–Miguel spent his weekends and spare evenings crafting the story. His friend Silvia Monge provided the illustrations.
Miguel says he has considered creating an English-language version of Sela, but needs to find the time. Meanwhile, he’s been working on a novel–it’s not about charming aquatic animals, but about human “grown-ups.” He’s looking for an agent, so if you know one ping him here.
