Today Gilt corporate applications–the team responsible for managing our OKTA services, among many many other things–put their own spin on Octoberfest by generously hosting a company-wide “OKTA-bierfest” celebration. The team covered our IT help desk with buckets of Yonkers Brewery bier and platters of cheese (both “standard” and “fancy” varieties, cupcakes, fruits ‘n’ nuts, and homemade pretzels. We’ve had several office parties since fall officially kicked off, but this one has generated the most buzz among tech–so far.
