The #gilttech team extends a hearty welcome to Pawel Raszewski, who joins our Dublin team as a software engineer on the super-secretive Team Twain. Before joining Gilt, Pawel worked at a gigantic media company where he developed web content optimization and personalization systems in Java. Heâ€™s also been involved in a couple of open source projects involving Chrome extensions, Android and Arduino.
Speaking of Arduino, in his spare time Pawel likes to build multipurpose flying robots. Watch the carrot:

Welcome, Pawel!
