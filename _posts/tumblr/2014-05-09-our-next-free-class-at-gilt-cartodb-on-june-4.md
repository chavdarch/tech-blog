If you deal with location-based data or location-aware applications, then we’ve got just the FREE class for you: On June 4, Andrew Hill of CartoDB will teach an evening workshop at Gilt’s NYC office!
CartoDB is a cloud-based mapping, analysis and visualization engine that enables users to build spatial applications for both mobile and the web. Major tech companies (Twitter), news organizations (National Geographic, The Guardian) governmental and intergovernmental organizations (NASA, the United Nations), and even Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are using it to craft beautiful maps and visuals out of their data–check out some examples here. A few of us on the #gilttech team are very interested in it, too, so we’re hosting this class–part of our ongoing free tech courses initiative–to learn more. And we invite you to learn with us!
Some of the cool stuff you can do with CartoDB:
Create interactive maps from CSVs
Map IP addresses to show trends over time
Publish online maps for public communication
Write APIs to integrate dynamic external data
Sync tools to build real-time maps from hosted data
Measure distance between points
Count and measure points in polygons
When:  Wednesday, June 4 from 5-9 PMWhere: Gilt’s Manhattan officesCost: FREE (includes dinner)Who: Gilt technologists, maybe you?
