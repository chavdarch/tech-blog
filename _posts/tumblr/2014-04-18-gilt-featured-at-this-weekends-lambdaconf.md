Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg traveled all the way to Boulder, Colo. this weekend to present at LambdaConf, a full-day conference featuring functional programming-related talks and workshops. Yoni’s talk focuses on the evolution of Gilt’s architecture from a monolithic Rails app to a distributed Scala micro-services system. Check out an earlier version of his presentation (from NYC Tech Talks earlier this year) below!
