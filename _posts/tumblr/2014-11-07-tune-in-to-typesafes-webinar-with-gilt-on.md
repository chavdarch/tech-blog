Fresh off his victory with Team Scalasaurus, Gilt Senior Software Engineer Michael Reed takes to the Typesafe webinar e-stage on Wednesday, November 12, when he presents a talk on “Responsive Tools and Pushy Actors.” Michael will talk about how Gilt uses Akka to scale our push notification infrastructure. He’ll also discuss how Akka faciliates scaling of our customer email and order aggregation systems in the context of our micro-services architecture, built with the Typesafe platform (Scala, Play Framework, Akka). 
Michael’s presentation is part of Typesafe’s day of “Reactive Retail” webinars. Go here to register!
