With so much of the NYC tech scene focused on software development, web development, and cloud-y things, it’s easy to overlook all the innovation taking place in the city’s clean tech, bioscience, robotics, and other hard-science scenes. One of the organizations working to promote the hard sciences locally is NY Tech Connect, a nonprofit organization that creates programs and events for start-ups and entrepreneurs that make tangible products. Last night I attended NY Tech Connect’s “Technology You Can Touch,” a showcase of sorts at WeWork that featured these young companies:
BOT Factory: Founded by a pair of NYU students, BOT Factory is working on a 3D circuit printer so that you can one day make circuit boards in the comfort of your own home.
KeyMe: Disrupting the locksmithing industry, KeyMe enables you to make copies of your house and office keys and store digital copies in the cloud. The company has already set up key-making kiosks at a few locations in NYC, so if you’re in the habit of losing your keys you might find this one useful.
Radicle Orthopedics: Part of the Columbia Business Lab, Radicle works with surgeons and medical device manufacturers on healthcare-related products.
Strongarm Vest: Not to be confused with the Strongbad mask, Strongarm Vest helps make lifting heavy objects easier and safer by redistributing weight from the arms and lower back to the stronger parts of the torso. A winner of the Rochester and New York State Business Plan Competitions, Strongarm was inspired by the founders’ own experiences watching their construction-worker relatives deal with pains and injuries sustained on the job.
Lumiode: Based in Brooklyn, this company focuses on making super-bright, energy-efficient, LED micro-displays.
Keen Home: This company’s automated air vents are designed to reduce excessive air conditioning and HVAC run times (by up to 30 percent, they claim).
Canary: Billed by its founders as “the world’s first smart home security device for everyone,” Canary alerts you via smartphone to suspicious or out-of-the-ordinary goings-on at your home. Canary launched a $100,000 Indiegogo campaign just this week and has already surpassed the $500,000 mark, so expect to hear lots more from them.
Coactive: This company works in the area of vibration technology. 
Vesselon: This healthcare start-up is developing a device that will enable paramedics to treat stroke victims as early as possible and, they hope, improve patient outcomes.
Looking forward to what NY Tech Connect and the companies above present next. Congrats to all involved for creating a thought-provoking and inspiring event.
