As fans and users of Apache Lucene/Solr, we’re excited to host the NYC Apache Lucene/Solr Meetup’s roundtable this Wednesday, Feb. 12. Titled “Lucene/Solr: The Default Search Engine for Hadoop,” the meetup will feature some of the biggest Hadoop vendors in the market discussing ways to access data in a quick and predictable way that also leverages many of the features users have come to expect from search. If you’re a software engineer or other technologist who’s hoping to learn more about search and big data, this is an event for you!
LucidWorks CEO Paul Doscher will host the roundtable, which will also feature Mark Miller of Cloudera, Mike Vogel of Knowledgent, and Joseph Caserta of Caserta Concepts. More on the night’s speakers:
Mark Miller is a Lucene/Solr committer and PMC member as well as an Apache member. After starting with Lucene in 2006, Mark has spent most of his time getting paid to work on the open source software projects that he loves. Mark is probably best known for his work on Lucene, Solr, and SolrCloud and is currently learning all about Hadoop while focusing on search as a software engineer at Cloudera.
Paul Doscher: As CEO, Paul is responsible for LucidWorks’ vision and success in the enterprise-wide search, discovery and analytics market. He comes to LucidWorks with 30 years of sales, marketing and business management experience within high-tech enterprise software. 
Joe Caserta is president of Caserta Concepts, a New York-based technology consulting firm that builds big data solutions for businesses and organizations.
Mike Vogel is a senior technologist and product manager at Knowledgent Group, a consultancy that advises companies on their big data initiatives.
Hope to see you here! Food and drink provided.
