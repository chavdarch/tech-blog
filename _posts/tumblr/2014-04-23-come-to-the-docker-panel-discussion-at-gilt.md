We’re super-excited to be cohosting a panel discussion with Docker and the Docker New York City meetup group next Tuesday, April 29! The event  starts at 6:30 PM at our 2 Park Avenue office and features Gilt Co-Founder/CTO Michael Bryzek, Docker VP of Services James Turnbull and DevTable co-founder Jacob Moshenko. Thrillist Lead DevOps Engineer/Docker NYC co-organizer Jesse White will moderate the panel, which will cover topics ranging from Docker’s evolution to Gilt’s work with Docker to improve continuous delivery of our micro-services architecture. RSVP here.
If you’re curious about Docker at Gilt and want to get a head start on preparing your Q&A questions for April 29, check out these lightning talks by Gilt engineers Jonathan Leibiusky and Rangarajan Radhakrishnan.
