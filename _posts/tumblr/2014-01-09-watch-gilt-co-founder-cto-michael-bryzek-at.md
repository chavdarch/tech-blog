Last month Gilt Co-Founder/CTO Michael Bryzek was the featured speaker at the monthly fireside chat organized by Startup Grind NYC,  the local chapter of the global Startup Grind community for entrepreneurs. “A full house for sure, but this was definitely our first event where fashion insiders may have outnumbered techies,” writes Startup Grind Community Manager Khari Parson. “One thing founders and fashion types can both agree on is that Gilt Groupe is at the top of its game with product and technology.” Check out Mike’s presentation above!
Startup Grind NYC’s next fireside chat on January 22 features VaynerMedia CEO and angel investor Gary Vaynerchuk; go here to RSVP.
