Tomorrow (Wed 7/10) Gilt CTO and cofounder Michael Bryzek will present “Truly Scale a Modern Tech Organization With Great Engineers” as part of AppNexus’ “Engineering @ Scale” series. Bryzek’s talk–which is free to the public–takes place at AppNexus’ office at 28 W. 23rd Street in Manhattan. Doors open at 6:30 PM, and the event lasts until 8:30 PM. RSVP here to claim your seat!
In his presentation, Bryzek will recount Gilt’s growth into a global leader with more than 1,000 employees. Gilt’s success is partly attributable to its embrace of decentralized decision-making and ownership within the organization–a strategy that Bryzek described at Tech in Motion’s recent “Made in NY: Tech Panel,” and will discuss in greater detail tomorrow. He’ll also share stories, based on real-life experiences, that will highlight the ways to successfully scale a technology organization and remain competitive. Hope to see you there!
