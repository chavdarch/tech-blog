Over the summer Gilt’s tech team had the honor of working with Nikita Rau, a participant in the Summer Immersion Program run by the nonprofit Girls Who Code. Nikita is an 18-year-old student at the Bronx High School of Science and an aspiring computer science major … and, now, a bit of a celebrity as well! The popular magazine Fast Company just published a lengthy feature article on Nikita that highlights her work with XX Hackers–a coding club for girls that she started in 2012–and participation in GWC’s amazing programs. Congrats to Nikita!
