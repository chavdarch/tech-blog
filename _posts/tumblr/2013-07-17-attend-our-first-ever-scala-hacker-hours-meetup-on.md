New to Scala? Working on a Scala project and need some guidance? Curious about the Typesafe platform, and interested in exploring it? Then grab your laptop and head on over to our 2 Park Ave. office in Manhattan on Wednesday, August 7 for our first-ever Scala Hacker Hours NYC meetup. The meetup begins at 6:30 PM and ends at 8:30 PM; light refreshments will be provided.
What’s a “hacker hours,” you ask? In his brand-new, open-source Hacker Hours DIY Guide, NYC developer and experienced hacker-hour host Aidan Feldman describes them as “free office hours for programming help; open to anyone, regardless of age or skill level; not a class, and not a lecture.” For our kick-off Scala session, several Gilt engineers will be available to answer your Scala-centric questions and point you in the right direction.
If you can’t make it on August 7, fret not: We’ll be hosting Scala Hacker Hours every other week. Join the meetup group to make sure you receive our announcements. Hope to see you on August 7!
