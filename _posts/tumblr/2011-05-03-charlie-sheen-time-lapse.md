Warlock, the client of our charlie_sheen application at Gilt.

On Friday, Apr 29th (the day of the Royal Wedding!), I recorded about 6 hours or so of Warlock running. I then sped it up until it was about 18 minutes long, and chopped off the beginning and end. Whatâ€™s left is a time lapse of incoming orders arranged geospatially.

Fast forward to about 6:00 to see the big burst of traffic we get at noon.
