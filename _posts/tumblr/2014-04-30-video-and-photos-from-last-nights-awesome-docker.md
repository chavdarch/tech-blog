Check out this action shot of Gilt co-founder and CTO Michael Bryzek performing a live Docker deploy at last night’s panel discussion! Organized by Gilt and the Docker NYC meetup group, last night’s panel featured Michael as well as Docker VP of Services James Turnbull and DevTable/Quay co-founder Jacob Moshenko. Joining us at our 2 Park Avenue office were more than 120 engineers from Gilt and other companies, who were treated to an informative discussion that covered everything from how Gilt has been using Docker to transform our infrastructure engineering operations to (and a wisecrack or two about immutability!).
For all of you who couldn’t make it, here’s a Google Glass recording of the panel provided by friend-of-Gilt Mike P.:

 Dinner provided by Num Pang–a hit every time! (Our personal favorite: the tofu sandwich.)

Gilt Lead Software Engineer Gregory Mazurek (right) chats with Yosef Fertel.

Nametags and beer: Two tech-meetup staples! 

Kicking things off with a short intro to Gilt!

Jesse White introduces the night’s panelists.

The audience listens closely to the panelists.

Michael gives the audience a brief history of infrastructure engineering at Gilt.

Jacob Moshenko talks about Quay, his service for storing and distributing Docker images.

James Turnbull of Docker takes a question from the audience.

Gilt co-founder and VP of Research and Development Phong Nguyen, who leads our Infrastructure Operations team, joins the conversation about our ongoing Docker work.
A huge thanks to our panelists, to Docker NYC (special shout-out to Victor Coisne of Docker and our panel moderator, Jesse White), and to our guests! Learn more about upcoming #gilttech events by joining our event announcements Meetup group.
