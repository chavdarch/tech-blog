Last week Gilt partnered up with DigBigData to offer a free Cassandra workshop near our Dublin office. Twenty-five technologists from Gilt and other area companies came together for a full day of hands-on learning, experimentation and fun! By workshop’s end the teams had created several exciting projects, including a CPU temperature monitor, a tweet sentiment analyzer, a multi-player, web-based game, and BigChat–a SnapChat-inspired service.
“It is always gratifying to see a group of people who may or may not know each other go from being individuals to getting together and forming cohesive teams and producing real mini projects with Cassandra,” says Niall Milton, our instructor for the day. Thanks to Niall and all our attendees for making our learning day so memorable!
