Last night we welcomed the Full-Stack Engineering meetup back to 2 Park for another night of tech talks and good times! Founded in November 2013 by greenhouse.io Director of Engineering Mike Boufford, Full-Stack promotes a modern and holistic approach to software development. Read our Q&A with Mike to learn more about this rapidly growing new meetup group for the NYC engineering community.
Last night’s speakers–NBCUniversal Enterprise Architecture Manager Sam Boyer, HUGE Principal Architect Isaiah Belle, and open-source advocate Rocky Bernstein–talked about a range of topics, from Symfony2 and Drupal to setting up an open-source project. A recap in photos:

Sandwiches from Num Pang hit the spot and earned rave reviews. Extra points for the vegetarian option!

Mixing and mingling in our cafe.

Guess the number of Gilt engineers in this picture!

The fellow in the vest is Gilt engineer Nathan Stilwell, who will present at February’s Full-Stack meetup (also at Gilt) on WebSockets. 
Thanks to everyone who attended! RSVP here for next month’s Full-Stack to catch Nathan, Mike Boufford (on “Mastering JavaScript”) and Vimeo Video Systems Engineer Dieter Plaetinck (discussing metrics and GraphExplorer).
