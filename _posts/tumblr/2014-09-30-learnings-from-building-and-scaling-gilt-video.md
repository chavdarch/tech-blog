Back in June, Gilt cofounder and CTO Michael Bryzek presented a talk about building and scaling Gilt’s global tech organization at InfoQ’s QCon New York conference–joining a lineup that included Adrian Cockcroft, Claudia Perlich, David Nolen (all of whom have spoken at or visited Gilt), Gil Tene (who will lunch with us next week) and Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg. Other speakers included CTOs and tech leads at LinkedIn, Facebook, NASA and Etsy.
