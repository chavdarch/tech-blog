In addition to being Principal Systems Engineer at Gilt, Jonathan Leibiusky is also the creator of Jedis: the open-source, super-popular Redis Java client. Next Monday (July 21) Jon will present a talk on Jedis and Redis at the NYC Java Meetup Group’s July meetup, hosted at our NYC office.  Jonathan will explain what Redis is, show the many different available data structures for Redis, and demonstrate how to use them from Jedis. He will also explain how to can build a Redis cluster (which is how Redis scales) and explain some of the recent updates he’s made to the Jedis project. 
This will be a great tech talk! To RSVP, just go here.
