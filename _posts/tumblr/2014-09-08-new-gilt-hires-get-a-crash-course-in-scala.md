Here’s Gilt Principal Software Engineer/Crafter O''Beers/Seasoned Instructor Gregor Heine leading one of his world-famous Scala trainings for our newer hires. (First Scala training in our schmancy new office!) Joining him as co-pilot for the first time is Gilt Senior Software Engineer Gary Coady, an expert in his own right. This class was Gilt-only, but we’re working on future installments for the public. Check back here for announcements!
