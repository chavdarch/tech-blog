Last week the women of #gilttech invited New York City-based documentary filmmaker Erin Bagwell (center) over to Gilt’s Manhattan office for snacks, bevs and an informal chat. Erin’s latest project is Dream, Girl: a documentary that tells the stories of women entrepreneurs. Watch a clip right here:
 
Erin just raised more than $100,000 to finish Dream, Girl. That’s nearly twice as much as she’d originally sought–a fact that indicates the strong interest in her project. And she’s alread received a lot of press coverage from the likes of Bust, Elle and The Daily Beast. The Gilt Tech women were excited to hear more about the inspiration behind the documentary and Erin’s plans for its completion. Thanks to Erin for visiting us!

Here’s Gilt VP Product Management & UX Dominique Essig talking with fellow (fellow-ess?) #gilttech women Chrissy Fleming and Lauren Ribando. Gilt engineers Nabila Yusaf, Jennifer Shin and Archana Kumar are in the back.
A delegation from Gilt’s International team also joined in for the discussion:
