Reaching out to young and aspiring technologists is a major priority for the #gilttech team. From hosting Girls Who Code to inviting Bronx Academy of Software Engineering students to tour our offices, we’ve derived immeasurable value from outreaching to the next generation of software engineers, mobile developers, and program managers. So when our friends at the New York City Economic Development Corporation invited us to participate in NYC’s first Computer Science Opportunity Fair–an event expected to draw 400 high schools students eager to learn about computer science education–we were excited. 
Held at Microsoft’s office in Times Square, tomorrow’s Opportunity Fair is a partnership between the NYCEDC and Technology Education And Literacy in Schools (TEALS)–the latter a program, coordinated by Microsoft, that brings CS instruction to public schools. The #gilttech delegation–software engineers Paolo Lim, Paul Lee, Jennifer Shin, Artie Motamed and Archana Kumar–will be on-site from 10 AM-2:15 PM to answer questions about our tech stack (and technology in general), demonstrate our API lessons on Codecademy and share some of their personal experiences about how they became software engineers. Thanks to NYCEDC and TEALs for inviting us to participate.
