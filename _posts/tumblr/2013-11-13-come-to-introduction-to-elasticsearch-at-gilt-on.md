Interested in Lucene/Solr, Elasticsearch and other search tools? Then come to Gilt’s Manhattan office on Monday, Nov. 18 for “Introduction to ElasticSearch,” the next event organized by the NYC Search, Discovery & Analytics meetup group. Hosted by Otis Gospodnetić­–founder of Sematext and a committer to Apache’s Lucene, Solr, Mahout, Nutch and Open Relevance projects–the meetup group is for anyone who is interested in search, discovery, analytics and related fields: information gathering, extraction, and retrieval, natural language processing, text analytics, data mining, sentiment detection, named entity recognition, and visualizations.
Monday’s featured presenter is Sematext Software Engineer Radu Gheorghe, who will discuss what Elasticsearch is and how it can act as your NoSQL data-store while providing quick, flexible and scalable search (for example, indexing logs or storing your product information so customers can search on them). Radu’s presentation includes a demo that meetup attendees can join.
There are a few spots left for the meetup, so RSVP here ASAP! Gilt will provide food and drinks.
