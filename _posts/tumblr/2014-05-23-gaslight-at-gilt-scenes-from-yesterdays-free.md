Here’s Gaslight Co-Founder and Developer Chris Nelson at the Gilt podium, leading yesterday’s free AngularJS class at our NYC office. Sixty technologists from Gilt, Urban Compass, OnDeck Capital, AppNexus and other companies joined us for the all-day course, which covered everything from client-side routing to dependency injection with services and factories. Some pics:

In addition to lectures, the day included hands-on exercises and a quick tour of the Gilt office.
Thanks to Chris for coming all the way from Cincinnati, Ohio to teach yesterday! And thank to everyone who attended the class–we had a great time learning alongside all of you!
