Last month’s free Gilt Tech course in NYC brought together 15 Gilt technologists and 45 non-Gilt employees from all walks of life–from software engineering to neuroscience–to learn the basics of the R programming language. For our next free class, we’re going a bit more intimate and Emerald-Isle with an Intro to Hadoop session taught in Dublin by MapR Technologies Chief Data Engineer Michael Hausenblas! The essentials:
When: Monday, November 18, 2013 from 10AM-6PMWhere:  Clarion Hotel IFSC, Excise Walk, Dublin 1Cost: Nothing!Who: Gilt technologists … and you?
About the course: This one-day, eight-hour class will introduce you to data processing with Hadoop. We will go through the underlying principles (data locality, schema-on-read), explain the Hadoop components (distributed file system, MapReduce) and review the Hadoop ecosystem (Hive, HBase) and upcoming projects. We’ll also walk through an end-to-end Hadoop application–from data ingestion over manipulation to serving–following the Lambda Architecture.
