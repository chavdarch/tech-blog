Just in time for the holiday shopping season, Typesafe recently hosted a day of “reactive retail” webinars featuring companies who use its technologies (Scala, Akka and Play). Stepping up for Gilt was Senior Software Engineer Michael Reed, who explained how Gilt uses Akka to scale our customer email, push notifications, and order aggregation systems. He also gave an overview of how Gilt uses the Typesafe platform to build our microservices architecture and took a few related questions from the audience.
Many thanks to Typesafe for inviting Gilt to be a part of this series. Go here to learn more about the other “Reactive Retail” webinars, which you can watch on Typesafe’s YouTube page.
