As long-time PostgreSQL users and supporters, we’re super-excited to host the New York City PosgreSQL User Group’s final meetup of 2013. The meetup takes place Wednesday, Dec. 11 at our 2 Park Avenue office.
Our very own Rangarajan Radhakrishnan will kick off the evening with a short presentation on Docker and Postgres. Then featured speaker and meetup organizer Jonathan S. Katz will explore the whole family of PostgreSQL indexes–B-tree, expression, GiST (of all flavors), and GIN–and discuss how they are used in theory and practice. There are only a few seats left, so RSVP ASAP!
