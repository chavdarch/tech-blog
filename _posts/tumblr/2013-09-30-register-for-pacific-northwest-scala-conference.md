Gilt’s proud to be a sponsor of the Pacific Northwest Scala Conference, which will bring together Scala enthusiasts from the Pacific Northwest and other areas for two days of short talks about a wide range of Scala-related topics. Hosted Oct. 19-20 at the Leftbank Annex in Portland, Ore., PNWScala will feature presentations on “JavaScript for Scala Nerds,” “Akka in Production,” Spire, functional raster image processing, and much more. Giving the keynote will be Paul Phillips, who will discuss how “We’re Doing It All Wrong”:

My conclusion after moving a million lines of code is that everything we do (plus or minus) is wrong. Henry Ford said “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” Our horses are now a billion times faster: our horses may well be the fastest in the galaxy. Are we too comfortable on our horses? Would we recognize better mounts if they came along, but didn’t look like horses? Is the state of our profession one which warrants pride, shame, or despair? I will explore these questions with unwarranted optimism.
