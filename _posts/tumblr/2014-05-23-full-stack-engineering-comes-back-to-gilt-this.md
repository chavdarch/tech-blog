After enjoying a relaxing (?) three-day weekend, get back into the heavy-duty tech-talk swing of things by coming to 2 Park on May 27 for the Full-Stack Engineering meetup! Even compared to past FSE speaker lineups this Tuesday’s is especially strong, with presenters representing three of NYC’s top tech companies:
Mike Brittain, Director of Engineering at Etsy, will discuss “Advanced Topics in Continuous Delivery”
Wes Chow, CTO at Chartbeat, will present on “Pseudorandomness in JavaScript”
and last–but definitely not least–Will Chiong, Lead Software Engineer at Gilt, on “Data-driven Personalization”
We’ll have food, drink, and–with +200 RSVPs and a waitlist–lots of company! Hope to see you here.
