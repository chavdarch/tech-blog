This week the New York Daily News published an article on our November visit with some very special guests: A group of girls from the Bronx Academy for Software Engineering! In addition to learning from some of Gilt’s women technologists about roles in business systems management, UX/design, project management and software development, the girls worked on an HTML app, shared lunch with the team, and took a tour of our office. They also got to meet and hear a talk from Gilt CEO Michelle Peluso, who told the NYDN that it was “wonderful to be able to give these girls a boost. It’s inspiring to all of us.” Agreed!
