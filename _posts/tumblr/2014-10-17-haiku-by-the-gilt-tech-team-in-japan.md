A snapshot from a recent Facebook event in Tokyo–that’s our mobile app on the screen! (First cupcakes, and now this? Facebook, we dedicate the following poetry to you as a small expression of our gratitude.)
The #gilttech team in Japan is getting into fall in a most poetic way–offering up these lovely haiku for our collective enjoyment. We highly recommend reading these poems while drinking some spiced tea.
