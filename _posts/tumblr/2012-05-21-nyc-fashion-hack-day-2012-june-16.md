What’s the NYC Fashion Hack Day? On Saturday, June 16, 2012, Gilt Tech is joining forces with two giants of their respective industries: Apigee, in the business of APIs and cloud platforms, and Tumblr, in the business of hosting and spreading the word about art and creativity and blogs about dogs on top of things. Together, we’re excited to host a 12-hour hackathon event at Gilt HQ in Midtown Manhattan in search of individuals and small teams who want to spend the day building a brand new application: web, desktop, mobile… whatever suits your fancy, we’d love to see you come out and make something!

All three companies will have people on hand to help you get up and running with our APIs & tools if that’s your thing, or else you can just come and work on a project if the idea of making something while meeting and networking with the NYC Tech scene is appealing to you.

At the end of the day we’ll be giving out prizes for best usage of the hosts’ APIs, most fashion-conscious application, and coolest technical accomplishment! Tickets are limited, so sign up today to reserve your spot!
