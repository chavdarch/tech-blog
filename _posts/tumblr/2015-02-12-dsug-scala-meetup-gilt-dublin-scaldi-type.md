ade-trenaman:Our thanks to all in the Dublin Scala User Group who attended the DSUG meet-up in our still shiny new Gilt office in Ballsbridge. Gilt’s own Ugo Matrangolo artfully dismantled the Cake Pattern in Scala, and proposed an alternative approach to dependency injection using the Scaldi framework (slides below). Julien Sirocchi from Workday also did a great presentation on ‘All You Don’t Need to Know About Type Classes’. Cameos from Functional Kats and Citi’s Aman Kohli, coupled with the customary selection of pizzas and craft beer, made for a great night! Thanks all for coming - we’re looking forward to welcoming the Dublin Scala community back soon for our free Scala Training in April.
