Check out Ryan Caloras, one of the Gilt Personalization Team’s dedicated software engineers (and a former Boston resident), manning our swag station at last week’s Boston Area Scala Enthusiasts meetup! Ryan’s team mate, Lead Software Engineer (and fellow ex-Bostonian) Yoni Goldberg, was the night’s featured speaker, and educated the crowd of 80-100 attendees about Gilt’s shift from a monolithic Rails app to a distributed micro-services architecture written in Scala. By the end of the night, almost all of our swag was gone.
Thanks to BASE and everyone who came out for a memorable night!
