Gilt Senior Director, PMO Heather Fleming and Director of Program Management Justin Riservato are the featured speakers at Agile NYC''s  meetup this evening at Pace University! Heather and Justin will demonstrate how an Agile PMO can help your organization make sure they are tackling the right work at the right time and with the right teams. They’ll share a retrospective on their multiple iterations, from “Request for Work” processes to “Swagathons” and something called “The Social Experiment”—and discuss how trust is really the key to scaling Agile at Gilt. 
The address for tonight’s event is 163 William St. (second floor); starting time is 5:30 PM. Go here to register.
