Tech@NYU is a week-long celebration of entrepreneurship, design and technology for the NYC tech community–a diverse and lively festival where you can learn how to build apps, code in CSS, start your own company, and much more. Gilt is proud to have technologists speak at two of the week’s events:
Tonight at 7:30 PM, Senior UX Designer David Park and Senior Interactive Designer Christopher Barr headline “Mobile Design at Gilt”–a talk on designing for mobile devices that provides both a UI and UX perspective
On Wednesday, November 5, Gilt Tech Evangelist Lauri Apple appears on the"Constructive Criticism“ panel from 7:30-9 PM. This even features technologists from Venmo, Square and other companies, as well as Girls Who Code, talking about workplace diversity in tech.
Hope to see you there!
