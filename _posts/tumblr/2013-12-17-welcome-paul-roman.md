We’re pleased as holiday citrus punch to welcome Paul Roman to Gilt! Based in Blacksburg, Virginia, Paul will work on our Distribution team.
Before joining Gilt, Paul worked on a real-time, contextual stream-processing PaaS and was responsible for REST, WebSocket, and XMPP API services. Prior to that, he worked on back-end services for a secure, real-time collaboration platform. His favorite technologies at the moment are Scala and Akka for building elastic, distributed systems (which is really convenient for us). He also likes functional programming and is not afraid to use the M word.
Outside of technology world, Paul is a yoga warrior, so if you run into him don’t be surprised if he talks to you about Ujjayi breath!
