As an engineer on Gilt’s back office team, one of the most exciting projects I worked on in 2013 was incorporating PayPal into the Gilt shopping experience. Exciting, because we knew that many of our members sought the option to make purchases with PayPal.
A few months ago we rolled out PayPal support on Gilt.com, GiltCity.com, and in Gilt’s iPhone application. Our implementation uses PayPal Express Checkout to establish a billing agreement between Gilt and the end user. The presentation above (click the pic) – a new revision of a talk I gave at the Capital District Java Developers Network’s October meetup – provides a quick overview of how PayPal works on our various platforms, and some of the engineering decisions we made to make it all happen.
