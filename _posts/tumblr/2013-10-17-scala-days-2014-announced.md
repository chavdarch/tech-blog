The friendly folks at Typesafe have just released the CFP for next year’s Scala Days conference, which takes place June 16-18 in Berlin. If you’re a sophisticated Scalasmith with some keen insights on Typesafe platform technologies, consider submitting a proposal before the deadline date of Nov. 29. Meantime, derive some inspiration by revisiting Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman’s Scala Days ‘13 presentation on “Scala & Symmetry” (Gilt was a platinum sponsor of this year’s conf, held in NYC).
