Here’s GitHub trainer/NYC tech scene dynamo Peter Bell hard at work teaching today’s Git and GitHub skills class at our 2 Park Avenue office! More than 50 students from Gilt, Adobe, Twitter, Webgrrls, the Park Slope Food Co-Op and other companies attended today’s all-day skills session. Thanks to Peter and fellow GitHub hacker/TA-for-today Aidan Feldman for putting on such a great class!
