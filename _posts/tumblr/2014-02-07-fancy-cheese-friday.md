Several months ago we taught you how to do high tea the Gilt tech way. Now we show you how to celebrate cheese: Fancy Cheese Friday.
Masterminded by Gilt software engineer Robert Brazier, Fancy Cheese Friday brings together non-vegan and lactose-tolerant Gilt technologists to rediscover the magic that is cheese. Today’s gathering–the second in our history–involved the following cheeses:
Kolan hard-pressed cow milk cheese
Lorenzo of Cazenovia, NY
Guggisberg Baby Swiss
Stilton
Plus baguettes, crackers and other bready things. Highlights:

Gilt engineer Asha Seetharam gets her cheese on.


Engineer/published author Miguel Angel Fajardo does the cutting.

This fellow, a distant cousin of Giovanni the Office Horse, showed up for a bite of Swiss.
