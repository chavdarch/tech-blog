We’re excited to host (for the first time!) the New York City Java Users Group’s monthly meetup, which takes place tonight at 6:30 PM at our 2 Park Ave. office. In addition to a recap of JavaOne 2013 by NYC JUG co-organizer Timothy Fagan, tonight’s event features a presentation on security by Bojan Simic from Contrast Security. To RSVP, just click here.
