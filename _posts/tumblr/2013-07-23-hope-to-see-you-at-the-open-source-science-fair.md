Gilt is excited to participate in the New York Times’ Open Source Science Fair 2.0, taking place Thu 7/25 (starting time 6:15 PM) at the Times’ office building in Manhattan. In addition to highlighting our open source work, our exhibit (one of those old-school, cardboard trifold thingies) will promote the Play Framework and discuss our use of Play at Gilt. Stop by our booth to say hello and to pick up some fashionable Scala, Play and Akka stickers and buttons (thanks to Typesafe for their generosity!). We’ll also answer any questions you might have about the Play NYC and Scala Hacker Hours NYC meetups.
