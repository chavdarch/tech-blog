If you’re one of the many aspiring entrepreneurs attending this weekend’s NYC Startup Weekend in the hopes of launching a successful new company or product in ~54 hours, be on the lookout for a friendly fellow wearing a Gilt Tech T-shirt. That would be Ryan Caloras, a software engineer on the Gilt personalization team. Ryan’s an entrepreneur himself: Before joining Gilt he was a co-founder and developer of Cool Hand Juke, which enables users to control the music at bars and cafes using a smart phone. He’ll be mentoring Startup Weekend attendees on how to launch a startup. Go seek his advice!
Ryan’s not the first Gilt technologist to participate in Startup Weekend activities. Scott Thompson–another engineer on our personalization team–served as a mentor at last June’s Startup Weekend. And Gilt Senior Software Engineer Sean Sullivan went to the 2013 Global Organizer Summit in Rio.
