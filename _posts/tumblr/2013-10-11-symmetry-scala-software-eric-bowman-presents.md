Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman is the next featured speaker at Refresh Dublin: an event series, inspired by the Refreshing Cities movement, that explores the relationships between design, UX and technology. On Tue 10/15, Eric will present “Symmetry, Scala & Software”–an updated iteration of his Scala Days talk–at the Science Gallery in Dublin. More details:

The concept of symmetry is pervasive across many fields: art, architecture, mathematics, even fashion. In the past decade or so, technologists have begun to talk about symmetry in the context of programming languages and the software programs created with them.
In this talk, we’ll explore the meaning and significance of symmetry beyond its superficial, primarily visual characteristics, and connect it to the practice of writing software. In particular, we’ll take a look at the Scala programming language, which manifests a profound degree of internal design symmetry.  We’ll also look at how that symmetry facilitates writing programs that are compact, elegant, and minimal. Finally, examine the importance of breaking symmetry, and introduce some new ideas around refactoring and conservation principles.

The event begins at 6:30 PM; to RSVP (and you should!), just go here.
