We’re all about the intersection of fashion and technology at Gilt, so we’re quite thrilled to host the next meetup of Decoded Fashion: a monthly showcase of demos and discussions for fashion and retail professionals. This month’s meetup focuses on tools that help fashion/eCommerce companies to drive up conversation and features a presentation by Gilt Director of Product Management Andrew Chen. The evening will also include demonstrations by Truefit, Stylitics, Olapic, and SmartGift. This event is sold-out, but Decoded Fashion has many more events coming up that you can attend!
