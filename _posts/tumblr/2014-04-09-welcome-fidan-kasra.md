Yesterday we introduced you to Program Manager Justin Vitale and his favorite furnishings. Today we welcome Fidan Kasra, who also joins our Program Management Office as a Senior Program Manager! Fidan will be working with our distribution team, which is part of Gilt’s Back Office.Originally from Texas, Fidan just moved to New York City from Germany, where she worked at a major ecommerce company as a project manager in charge of logistics projects. Prior to that, Fidan worked as a consultant–helping fashion retailers around the globe with supply-chain and merchandising initiatives. She’s passionate about retail operations and technology, and we’re ecstatic to have her join the team!
In her spare time Fidan likes to travel and explore different cultures and languages. And despite her Texas roots, she owns no cowboy boots.
