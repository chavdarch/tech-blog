On Tuesday night Gilt hosted our last evening tech event of the year: the second-ever gathering of the Full-Stack Engineering Meetup. What an amazing turnout! More than 100 software engineers (including 19 Gilt technologists), tech execs, and programming students braved the chilly temps and icy sidewalks to spend a few hours at our 2 Park office eating pizza, chatting about coding, and listening to some great technical presentations.
We’re super-excited to host Full-Stack again on January 28–go here to RSVP. Meantime, here are some pics of the night:

Gilt Senior Software Engineer Casey Kolderup started off the evening’s talks with a presentation on the Gilt APIs.

Another shot of Casey–nice sticker collection he’s got there!


We were happy to see Customer.io founder John Allison again. Once upon a time, John was a Gilt software engineer. 


“So what is Docker”? James Turnbull–author, open source advocate, and Docker’s new VP of Services–brought the audience up to speed on one of the most exciting technologies of 2013.
Thanks to Full-Stack Engineering organizer Mike Boufford for producing such a fantastic event, and to everyone who joined us! We hope to see you next month.
