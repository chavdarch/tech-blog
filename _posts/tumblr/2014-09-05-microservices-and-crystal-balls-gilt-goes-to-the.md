The Atlassian Summit is probably the top conference worldwide for project managers, program managers and anyone else who spends a lot of time thinking about agile development–and Gilt will be there! Gilt Senior Director, Program Management Office Heather Fleming and Director of Program Management Justin Riservato will share their talk “Beyond the Crystal Ball–The Agile PMO” on the second day of the conference, which takes place September 9-11 in San Jose, CA. Heather and Justin take the stage at 11:15 AM PST in Room 2.
But that’s not all: Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg will give his super-popular talk on “Scaling Microservices at Gilt” (seriously–he’s delivered it in at least four U.S. states this year!) on Thursday, Sept. 11 at 11:10 AM PST in Room 7.
