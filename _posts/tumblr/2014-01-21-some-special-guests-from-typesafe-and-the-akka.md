Last Thursday Gilt had the pleasure of hosting Typesafe Developer Advocate James Ward and Director of Sales Tim Kirk, Akka Team member Henrik Engström, and a small group of NYC-based Typesafe platform enthusiasts for dinner at our 2 Park Ave. office. Over beer and Turkish food, about 27 of us spent a few hours talking about Typesafe’s efforts to educate people on how to program in Scala, the future of Play Framework, object-relational mapping, and much more. Thanks to all of our guests for attending!
We’re excited to invite Henrik back to Gilt this Thursday to work from our office and hang out. More on that to come!

LinkedIn engineer Mike Pigott chats with Tim Kirk.

Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg talks Scala with Michael Hamrah of Getty Images.
