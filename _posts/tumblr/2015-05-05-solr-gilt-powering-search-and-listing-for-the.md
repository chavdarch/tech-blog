Reserve your spot before they’re all gone!Learn how we adopted Solr at Gilt to provide personalised search results, from early days using Solr 3 on just three nodes, to a more modern clustered deployment today running Solr 4 that powers all listing pages on Gilt through our daily pulse load at noon. We’ll discuss what worked, what didn’t, and where we’re going next for search on gilt.com.If you haven’t yet heard Ade Trenaman speak, you are in for a treat!  Be there: Thursday, May 14th at 6:30pm!
