Yours truly will mentor teams during this weekend’s first-ever Code the Deal: a hackathon in which participants will create tech products to improve legal and business transactions. Organized by the New York chapter of Legal Hackers–worldwide organization for lawyers, policymakers, academics and entrepreneurs interested in the intersection of law and technology–the hackathon will run from Friday to Sunday, Sept. 19-21 and feature talks, parties, and prizes for the winning teams. In addition to Gilt, other companies and institutions providing mentors or judges include Etsy, Brooklyn Law School, Thomson Reuters and Nixon Peabody.
