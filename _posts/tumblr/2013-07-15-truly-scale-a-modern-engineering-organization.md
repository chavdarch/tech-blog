For those of you couldn’t make Gilt co-founder/CTO Michael Bryzek’s talk at AppNexus last Wednesday (maybe because you were attending the Play NYC meetup?); click here to view the slides. Bryzek’s talk covered Millennials in the workplace, Gilt’s social experiment, the value of using key performance indicators (KPIs) and much more. Thanks again to AppNexus for hosting the event.
