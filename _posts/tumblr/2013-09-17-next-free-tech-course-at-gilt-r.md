We’re excited to invite the NYC tech community to our next free course: Introduction to R, taught by Jared Lander. The details:
When: Friday, October 4, 2013 from 9:30 AM-5:30 PM
Where: Gilt’s office in Manhattan
Cost: Nothing!
Who: Gilt technologists, and possibly you (must be age 18 or older)
About the course: The class is divided into four parts: Basic intro material, data munging, visualization, and modeling. No prereqs required, other than knowing how to operate a computer (prior programming experience won’t hurt, though!).
About Jared Lander: Jared Lander is a statistical consultant based in New York City, the co-organizer of the New York Open Statistical Programming Meetup and an Adjunct Professor of Statistics at Columbia University.  With a masters from Columbia University in statistics and a bachelors from Muhlenberg College in mathematics, he has experience in both academic research and industry.  His work for both large and small organizations ranges from music and fund raising to finance and humanitarian relief efforts.  He specializes in data management, multilevel models, machine learning, generalized linear models, data management and statistical computing.  He is the author of an upcoming book for Addison Wesley about R programming for non-statisticians.
