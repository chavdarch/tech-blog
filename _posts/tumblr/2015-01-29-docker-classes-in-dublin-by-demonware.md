Yesterday and today, Gilt’s tech team in Dublin hosted free, all-day Docker bootcamps taught by the generous folks at DemonWare. DemonWare’s instructors covered all the essential Docker basics, from listing images to caching, and did a fantastic job doing it. Several Gilt engineers joined technologists from other companies in Dublin in taking advantage of this helpful Docker primer. Thanks, DemonWare!
