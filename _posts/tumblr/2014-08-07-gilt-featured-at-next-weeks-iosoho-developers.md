If you’re a practicing iOS developer who lives in NYC (or who plans on parachuting in over the weekend), don’t miss Monday’s iOSoho meetup. The night’s featured presenter is Gilt Principal Engineer Evan Coyne Maloney, who will discuss how to gracefully handle changes to your server-side data model and also give a preview of Mockingbird: the platform on which Gilt’s iPhone and iPad apps are built, and which we plan on releasing as open source sometime before the end of the year. Seats are almost gone, so RSVP here.
