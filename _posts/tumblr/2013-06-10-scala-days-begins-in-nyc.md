Greetings from the Scala Days conference! Here’s a pic of Gilt Techies Mark Wunsch (NYC office, yellow shirt) and Eric Bowman (Dublin office, button-down) repping at our official booth, where we’re giving out stickers, pens, info sheets, and official conference swag bags.
Gilt is a platinum sponsor of this year’s conference, taking place now through June 12 at the historic Hudson Theatre in NYC. Scala Days 2013 features a lunchtime presentation by Eric (Tuesday, 1PM) and two full days of talks by Typesafe leaders and Scala enthusiasts from around the globe. If you’re attending the conference, stop by our booth and say hello! We’ve brought an iPad so you can check out our Gilt API lessons at Codecademy and are happy to answer any questions you might have about how we’re using Scala, Play and Akka.
