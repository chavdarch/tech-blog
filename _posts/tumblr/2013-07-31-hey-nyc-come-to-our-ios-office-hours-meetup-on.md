Earlier this week we became co-organizers and sponsors of the iOS Office Hours: a bimonthly, two-hour meetup for folks seeking help with iOS and Objective-C programming. Created by the team at Code Coalition (they’re changing their name from BitFountain), iOS Office Hours began meeting in March 2013 and quickly outgrew its meeting space. Office Hours founders Eliot Arntz and Teddy Wyly teach iOS workshops at the Kanye-approved learning center General Assembly and have taught programming in underserved communities. We’re excited to work with them!
We’ll be kicking off our partnership with a Tue 8/13 meetup featuring short talks by Gilt Principal Software Engineer Evan Maloney and members of the Code Coalition crew, followed by casual Q&A with resident experts from both companies. Bring your laptop and your questions about iPhone development, and we’ll help you try to solve your latest development problems. All skill levels are welcome.
