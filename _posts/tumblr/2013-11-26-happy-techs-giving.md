Today weâ€™re feeling grateful for our Culture in Tech team, who organized our first-ever TECH-sgiving last Friday. The lunchtime celebration included an assortment of delicious and sugary pies, cakes, and cupcakes from across the autumn-flavor spectrum. Also spotted: a single salad.

Which pie looks most tempting to you?
