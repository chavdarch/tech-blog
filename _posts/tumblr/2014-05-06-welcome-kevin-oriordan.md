Gilt is excited to welcome Kevin O''Riordan to our tech team! Based in Dublin, Kevin is a software engineer and joins our push team. Before arriving at Gilt, he spent more than three years developing software (more specifically, behavioral targeting software) to support online advertising campaigns. A native of Cork, he studied at University College Cork.
In his free time, Kevin enjoys hill running, mountain biking, adventure racing and skiing. Weâ€™re glad to have him on board!
