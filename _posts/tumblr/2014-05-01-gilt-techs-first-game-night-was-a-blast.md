Last week Gilt’s tech team in New York City organized our first-ever game night! Headed up by Team Teaminess–our internal working group of #gilttech cultural evangelists–game night included 10 different games as well as health foods (tacos, pizza) and drinks (beer, seltzer water). Here are some photos of the fun!

This Taboo game went on for hours …


Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg ponders his next move. BTW, that’s a game of Bughouse, a chess variant. “I learned it from Tom Brown, the CTO of Grouper, who was my roommate at school,” Yoni says.

Gilt City completely dominated this card game. So did that giant pan of chips (almost!)

We offered a variety of pongs, including beer pong …

… and ping pong!

Nirvana and Monopoly: two classic tastes
Go Team Teaminess!
