Just in time for the holidays, #gilttech offers a free gift for the NYC tech community: an opportunity to learn Chef! Chef is an automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. On December 4, we host an all-day hands-on tutorial that will cover the basics that everyone needs to know about how to use Chef for system and infrastructure management. Your instructor, Nathen Harvey, will discuss the server API, the code primitives, and the tools required to successfully use Chef.
The essentials:
When: Thursday, December 4, 2014 from 9 AM-5 PMWhere: Gilt office in ManhattanCost: Nothing!Who: Gilt technologists … and you?
Instructor Bio: As the Community Director at Chef, Nathen helps the community whip up an awesome ecosystem built around the Chef framework. Nathen also spends much of his time helping people learn about the practices, processes, and technologies that support DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and Web-scale IT.  Prior to joining Chef, Nathen spent a number of years managing operations and infrastructure for a number of web applications.  Nathen is a co-host of the Food Fight Show, a podcast about Chef and DevOps.
