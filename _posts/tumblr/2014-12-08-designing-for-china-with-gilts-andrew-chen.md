Here’s Gilt Director of Product Andrew Chen sharing his expertise at last week’s Design Driven NYC about creating amazing customer experiences for the Chinese market. “It really isn’t just about the front-end, on-face user experience–it is the entire end-to-end experience that’s important here,” he says about our recent relaunch for 11/11. Andrew presented along with designers from Codecademy, FiftyThree and Cover.
Many thanks to FirstMark Capital and WeWork for putting together an amazing event for the NYC cesign and tech community!
