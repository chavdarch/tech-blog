We’re proud to announce that we’ve become an official “Friend” of the Pacific Northwest Scala Conference–taking place October 19 and 20 in Portland, Ore. The conference is still in the early planning stages, but lots of short talks and open sessions are in the works. We’ll keep you updated on new developments as the date gets closer.
