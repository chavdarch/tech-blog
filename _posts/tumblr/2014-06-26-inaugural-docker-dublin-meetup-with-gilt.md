After going west to tell the audience at DockerCon 2014 about our work with Docker, Gilt Co-Founder and CTO Michael Bryzek is heading east across the Atlantic to headline Docker Dublin’s first-ever meetup! Michael will discuss how Gilt’s engineering team has been experimenting with Docker to improve and simplify end-to-end continuous delivery of our micro-services architecture, which to date includes more than 300 micro-services. He’ll highlight some of the benefits Docker offers to engineers, such as stability, repeatability, and the flexibility to create lightweight environments. Finally, he’ll discuss how Gilt is using Docker in AWS to provide immutable software deployments to production.
If you’re excited about Docker and live in Dublin (or have a pet whale who’s willing to transport you there), you should definitely attend this event! The meetup takes place Wednesday, July 9 at Engine Yard; go here to RSVP. Hope to see you (and your whale) there :)
