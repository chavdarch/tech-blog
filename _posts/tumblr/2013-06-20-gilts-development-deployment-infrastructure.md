As an organization, we’re able to provide more value to our customers and adapt to changes more effectively when developers can focus on coding and not on other tasks which can be automated instead. On Tuesday, I spoke at Open Source Bridge about “Innovating Faster with a Micro-Service Architecture using SBT, Continuous Delivery, and LXC.“ In the talk, I discussed some of the development and operational infrastructure we’ve created at Gilt to support the rapid development of new features while simultaneously evolving our architecture from a monolithic Rails application to a constellation of over 200 microservices and small web applications.
