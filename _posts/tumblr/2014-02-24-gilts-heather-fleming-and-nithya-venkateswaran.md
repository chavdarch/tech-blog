This Wednesday (Feb. 26) Gilt Senior Director, Program Management Office (PMO) Heather Fleming is one of the featured panelists at “Being Comfortable while Being Uncomfortable”–a Women in Tech panel organized by ISpossible. Heather and HUGE Experience Director Sophie Kleber will talk about how to flourish in sometimes-uncomfortable or unfamiliar environments, and how to regard being outside one’s comfort zone as a fun challenge instead of a reason for anguish/anxiety.
As an added bonus, Gilt QA Engineer Nithya Venkateswaran will warm up the crowd with a series of improv games, including “pass the expression” and a “pet peeve rant."Nithya does improv in her spare time and is getting to put her skills to great use!
Attending this women-only event is FREE–just RSVP here.
