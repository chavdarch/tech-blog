Recently we announced that our resident Scala experts in Dublin will teach a free, one-day beginners-level Scala course on August 30 and September 13. Now we have some exciting news for the NYC tech community: on Monday, September 9 our Manhattan office will host a free Introduction to Machine Learning course taught by John Myles White. The TL; DR version…
When: Monday, September 9, 2013 from 10AM-6PM
Where: Gilt, 2 Park Ave., 5th Floor
Cost: Nothing!
Who: Gilt technologists, possibly you
About the course: This one-day class will cover the basics of machine learning concepts such as regression, classification and data reduction. It will also touch upon some specific topics around recommendations/personalization applications and Bayesian networks. The course will be more algorithmic than mathematics-intensive, so if you’re a bit rusty on your calculus and linear algebra you can still keep up with the class.
About John Myles White: John is the author of several books (including Machine Learning for Hackers and Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization); the author of ProjectTemplate and log4r packages for R; a developer of the Julia programming language; a Hacker School resident; and an organizer of the DataGotham conference. He earned his Ph.D. in Psychology from Princeton. We’re glad to catch him right before he moves west to become a data scientist at Facebook.
