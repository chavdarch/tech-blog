On Friday afternoon Gilt’s tech team was honored to host Dr. Roland Kuhn of Typesafe, who stopped by our NYC office to have some lunch and to chat with a few of our engineers. Based in Sweden, Dr. Kuhn was passing through NYC on his way from Philadelphia, where the night before he appeared at the Philly Area Scala Enthusiasts meetup and led a live-coding session.
The leader of the Akka Team, and a co-instructor (with Martin Odersky and Eric Meijer) of Coursera’s “Principles of Reactive Programming” course, Dr. Kuhn is also a co-author of the Reactive Manifesto. One of the Akka team’s most exciting recent projects is Reactive Streams, “an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure on the JVM.” Here at Gilt we handle live feeds of all kinds, notes Gilt Senior Software Engineer Giancarlo Silvestrin. “To have a standard way to handle them asynchronously with automatic back pressure is something I’m really interested in,” he says.
If you’d like to learn more about Reactive Streams, don’t miss Dr. Kuhn’s May 7 webinar (9-10 AM PST). Also check out Akka Streams, Typesafe’s new, open-source Akka implementation of the Reactive Streams draft specification.
Thanks to Dr. Kuhn for spending Friday afternoon with us!
