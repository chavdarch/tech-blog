On Monday night Gilt had the great and unforgettable honor of hosting a talk by Dr. Martin Odersky–author of Scala, the programming language used by Gilt and so many other top companies worldwide; and Chairman, Chief Architect and Co-Founder at Typesafe. Software engineers from Comcast, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Twitter, Palantir Technologies and dozens of other companies joined us for the event, held at Gilt’s Midtown Manhattan office. Scala engineers from around the world emailed or tweeted us to express regret that they wouldn’t be able to attend, so for all of you: Here are some highlights of what you missed!
A bit of Scala for the Impatient: Here’s the video of Dr. Odersky’s fascinating talk (go here for the slides):

The check-in line at around 6:30 PM:

The great folks at Num Pang provided dinner for us and our guests:

Some of Gilt’s Dublin-based engineers flew in for Dr. Odersky’s talk. Here’s Principal Software Engineer (and an experienced Scala evangelist in his own right) Gregor Heine chatting with software engineer Chinmay Bijwe:

At ~7PM we all took our seats–lots of seats! A panoramic shot:

Some digital-souvenir collecting:

“Who here is actually using Scala or has used Scala? Almost everybody? Great!”–Dr. Odersky polled the crowd, and just about everyone raised their hands:

The audience listens:

Dr. Odersky’s talk focused on the “simple parts” of Scala, and gave some context on the language he created 10 years ago this year (Happy Birthday, Scala!):

Henrik Engström, Tech Lead Typesafe Console (and a Gilt featured speaker in June!), wore his Typesafe tee for the occasion:

Gilt engineers Sean Smith and Jim Englert took the only seats they could find:

Dr. Odersky spoke for an hour and took many questions afterward:

After Dr. Odersky’s talk, many people stayed for more food, drink and tech-talk. Here, Gilt CTO and Co-Founder Michael Bryzek chats with Henrik Engström of Typesafe and a few other guests:

Tim Kirk of Typesafe (far left) says hello to a familiar face while the last of the sandwiches goes to a lucky guest:

A huge thanks to Dr. Odersky and everyone at Typesafe for making Monday night possible! We look forward to seeing you at Scala Days in June!
