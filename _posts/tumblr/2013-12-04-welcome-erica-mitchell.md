Dublin-based Software Engineer Erica Mitchell recently joined Gilt’s architecture team, and works on building the next generation of our dev tools. She’s already gotten into the Gilt groove–taking our Intro to Scala and Intro to Hadoop courses and organizing some fun group outings!
Before joining Gilt, Erica was a Java/Groovy developer and worked on social networking initiatives (for example, integrating social content with mobile devices); converting product build systems to Gradle; building and supporting daily deployments to development, sales demo and test environments; and creating deployment artifacts for deployment engineers for staging. She’s also been an Eclipse plugin developer and a Java UI developer. 
 Outside of work, Erica is a volunteer with Arthritis Ireland–leading walking groups and helping to deliver the “Living Well with Arthritis” course. We’re excited that she’s joined the team!
