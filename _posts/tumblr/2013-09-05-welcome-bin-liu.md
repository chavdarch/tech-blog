Please say hello to Bin, who just joined our Gilt City team as a software engineer. Bin will be working primarily in Scala to enhance our personalization efforts. He’s a full-stack engineer who has worked mainly in Python/Django, with specialization in data aggregation and platform engineering. He’s excited about the opportunity to program in the technologies we use here. He likes sports–“almost all of them.”
