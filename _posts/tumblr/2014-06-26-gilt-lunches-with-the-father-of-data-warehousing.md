Recently Bill Inmon, known to many a data scientist as “the father of data warehousing,” stopped by the Gilt office in NYC–very cool! Mr. Inmon was in town as the featured speaker of “BIG DATA and Enterprise Architecture 2014,” hosted by the Data Management Forum, and swung by 2 Park for some vegetarian food and photo-taking. “He wasn’t shy about his feelings on some of the software we work with,” says one Data team member, who adds that Mr. Inmon also has a great sense of humor. We hope he visits us again!
