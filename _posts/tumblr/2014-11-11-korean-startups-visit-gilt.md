Gilt recently had the incredible honor of hosting a delegation of representatives from the Korean tech community. Our visitors were spending time in NYC and Silicon Valley through an accelerator program sponsored by Google, and included representatives from these startups:
Genoplan (health and lifestyle)
Snapshop (ecommerce)
Fivethirty (reinventing origami)
Notivo (information-tracking)
ChocoPepper (mobile game broadcasting)
Promisope (social networking for caregivers)
After taking a quick tour of our office, the group got to hear from Gilt Director of International Marketing Dan Jee about our marketing efforts in Korea. Here’s Dan:

Then Gilt cofounder and CTO Michael Bryzek shared his perspective on Gilt’s early days and what it was like to be one of the technical co-founders of a global tech company. He also described the evolution of our tech culture, covering our microservices architecture and our focus on trust, autonomy, decentralization and team ownership of end-to-end quality:

Thank you to our Korean guests for spending time at Gilt and for making our afternoon memorable! And thanks to Google Korea for writing about our visit.
