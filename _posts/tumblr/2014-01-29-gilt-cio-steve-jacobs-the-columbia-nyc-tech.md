Last night Gilt CIO and Columbia alum Steve Jacobs (PhD, Electrical Engineering) visited his alma mater to participate in a lively panel discussion hosted by the NYC Tech Talent Draft. Steve joined representatives from Buzzfeed, Adobe, Fog Creek Software and other top NYC tech companies in answering questions about how to land a tech job in NYC, the kinds of exciting challenges that professional engineers get to work on and solve every day, and other career-related topics. Gilt Product Manager and fellow Columbia alum Jeff Bobula also attended the panel to answer questions about career opportunities at Gilt and the skills one needs to build a successful career in product management.
