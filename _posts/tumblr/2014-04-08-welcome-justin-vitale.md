We’re excited to add Justin Vitale to Gilt’s Program Management Office! Justin joined Gilt in May 2011 as a member of our IT department, and very recently made the switch to our PMO. He’ll continue working on IT projects and bringing along his fancy furniture, including his red velvet rope, wherever he goes. 
Originally (“and proudly!”) from the Jersey Shore, Justin has lived in NYC since 2007. Outside of work he “lives and breathes” hockey and golf. “I’ve been playing both sports since I was eight or nine, and I won’t stop until my legs literally fall off,” he says. We’re committed to helping Justin to keep his limbs attached, so we’ve already started him off on a strict athletic regimen that includes some of his longtime favorite sports as well as some brand-new ones.
