Here’s Gilt CTO and co-founder Michael Bryzek answering a question from the audience at last week’s installment of Alley Weekly, AlleyNYC’s Friday lunchtime Q&A series. Around 50 people came out to hear Michael talk about how Gilt got started, how we work, the importance of trust in scaling a successful tech organization, and many other topics. Thanks to Sam Hysell and AlleyNYC for inviting us to participate!
