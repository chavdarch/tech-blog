For all of you 9-to-5ers who enjoy your free Gilt tech courses to take place after work, great news: Our next freebie will be an evening course. The focus: data visualization. But not just any data visualization: This three-hour session will cover visualizations for forests, trees and clustering in the context of visualization for multivariate analysis. Leading the way will be Paul Trowbridge, an adjunct instructor at NYU’s Center for Advanced Digital Applications.
Multivariate, high-dimensional data sets pose challenges for low-dimensional visual representation, interpretation and communication. In this class, Paul will explore clustering, trees and Random forests–three common methods for analyzing multivariate data when classification and prediction are key goals of the analysis. He’ll introduce each analysis method, and present visualization strategies and techniques for each method–focusing on Random forests. He’ll review these existing visualization methods, teaching how to produce and interpret each visual. He’ll then proceed to explore some visualization strategies to diagnose and study the quality of the prediction and classification output of a Random forest analysis. Each step in his presentation will draw from relevant example data sets.
The essentials:
When: Thursday, October 23, 2014 from 5-9 PMWhere: Gilt office in ManhattanCost: Nothing!Who: Gilt technologists … and you?
About the instructor: In addition to teaching at NYU, Paul is a PhD student in Statistics at Rutgers and organizer of the meetup group Data Visualization New York, which has +2200 members.
