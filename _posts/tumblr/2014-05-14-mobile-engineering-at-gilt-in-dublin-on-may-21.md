Gilt Senior Software Engineer Christine Yokoyama, who’s based in New York City and belongs to Gilt’s Webby Award-winning mobile team, will stop by Engine Yard’s Dublin office next Wednesday evening (6:30 PM) to give an overview of mobile engineering at Gilt. She’ll talk about some of the unique challenges that Gilt’s mobile team faces, the technologies we use, and much more.
If you’re a Dublin iOS or Android developer, bring your friends and your questions about Gilt mobile engineering! We’ll have pizza and beer ready for you. Just go here to RSVP.
