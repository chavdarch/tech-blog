#gilttech’s excited to announce that Roland Tritsch will be the featured speaker at the next Dublin Scala Users Group meetup! Roland, who is Director of Business & Application Services at Fujitsu UK and Ireland, will present “Scala, Android & Bluetooth Low Energy: How to Make It All Work Together?” He’ll show us how to build Scala apps for Android and will then introduce the Scaloid framework as a way to do Scala development “the Scala way” on Android. As part of the presentation, we will build a simple BLE scanner (looking for beacons).
Roland has more than 25 years of experience building, running and fixing software engineering organisations and large distributed systems. His background includes positions at IONA Technologies, Gilt and HP. He likes computers, software and cycling, and these days is most interested in finding ways to make the “Internet of Things” work.
Roland’s an excellent speaker and teacher–we have first-hand knowledge of this!–so this will be a don’t-miss. Go here to RSVP!
