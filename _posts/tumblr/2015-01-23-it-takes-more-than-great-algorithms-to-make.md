“[R]elying on data and math alone won’t suffice when it comes to providing the best user experience,” writes Gilt Senior Software Engineer Brian Ballantine in his new column for VentureBeat. “To get personalization right, you need heuristics: a set of problem-solving techniques that rely on experiment, experience, and sometimes even wild guesses.” What are heuristics, and how does Gilt use them to optimize our personalization efforts?
