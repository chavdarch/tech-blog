Since mid-summer 2013 Gilt and Code Coalition have been partnering up to co-host iOS Office Hours: free, monthly programming help sessions for mobile app developers of all levels. In just a few short months we’ve doubled our membership rolls, helped many a developer overcome their development-related obstacles, and made a bunch of new friends in the iOS community. So let’s celebrate! 
On Monday, December 9, iOS Office Hours will hold its last meetup of 2013 with demonstrations by Moven, Flonation, Calvin and RISE. We’ll close out the year with some holiday-themed treats, warm beverages, and–as always–free programming help! Several Gilt engineers will be present to answer questions about mobile development at Gilt.
