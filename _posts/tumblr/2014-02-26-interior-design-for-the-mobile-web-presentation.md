Last night Gilt and the NYC CSS/UX meetup group welcomed more than 100 engineers, UX designers and other tech professionals to our NYC office for “Interior Design for the Mobile Web”–a talk by Gilt Lead Software Engineer Greg Mazurek.

Greg took the audience through how we design at Gilt, then discussed Card UI (the present) and Web Components (the future).
