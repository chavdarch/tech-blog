InfoQ’s August 2014 e-magazine, titled “Microservices: Decomposing Applications for Deployability and Scalability,” includes a few mentions of Gilt’s microservices architecture. Author Chris Richardson includes us in his article about microservices’ advantages and disadvantages. And Battery Ventures fellow Adrian Cockcroft–former Cloud Architect at Netflix, Chief Architect for High Performance Technical Computing at Sun Microsystems, and founding member of eBay Research Labs (not to mention past lunch guest at Gilt)–also mentions Gilt in his conversation with InfoQ EIC Charles Humble.

While you’re visiting InfoQ, check out Gilt Lead Software Engineer Yoni Goldberg’s interview with Werner Schuster. Yoni gave a presentation at QCon New York 2014 on our microservices architecture and Scala, and shares some choice excerpts.
