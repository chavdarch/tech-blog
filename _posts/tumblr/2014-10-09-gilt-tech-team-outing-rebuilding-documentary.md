Earlier this week #gilttech’s Lauren Ribando, Rangarajan Radhakrishnan and I headed north to the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen in Midtown for a public screening of Rebuilding: artist/filmmaker Marcus Robinson’s visually stunning documentary about the reconstruction of the World Trade Center site and the men and women who did the work. Robinson started work on his film in 2006–capturing the construction activity on time-lapse film and through his own wonderful paintings, which are interspersed throughout the film (and currently on exhibit on the 48th floor of Tower 4). Robinson’s poignant interviews with carpenters, foremen, surveyors, iron workers, window installers and other workers give a human face to the gargantuan WTC project, and also reflect the intimacy and trust he was able to establish with the crew. Rebuilding makes a powerful statement about the resilience of the human spirit, while documenting the incredible perseverance of both the filmmaker and his subjects.
Rebuilding has been featured on the History Channel and the UK’s Channel 4; find out about upcoming showings by signing up for the film’s enewsletter. And if you’re in NYC, take some time to visit the Tradesmen’s building–it’s a New York City landmark and on the National Register of Historic Places.
