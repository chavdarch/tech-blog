Come to Gilt on Wed 3/5 (6:30 PM) for the Hackers Union’s third Hacker Forum: an evening of conversation and lightning talks by Gilt engineer Jonathan Leibiusky and Huffington Post engineer Mike Adler. More on the featured presentations:
“Exploring Docker at Gilt”: Jon LeibiuskyOver the past few months, a team of engineers at Gilt has been experimenting with Docker: an exciting new open source engine that makes it possible to create and run applications in their own lightweight containers. (You might call it “worry-free continuous deployment.”) In this short talk, Jon will describe what Docker is, what it does, and why Gilt has joined other companies in exploring this promising new technology despite its not-quite-finished state. He’ll also briefly discuss some of the ways that Docker stands to compliment Gilt’s distinctive micro-services architecture (450 applications and counting), and some of the discoveries he and his colleagues have made during their work.
“The Perfect Provisioning Tool”: Mike AdlerMike Adler will facetiously define the criteria for the perfect provisioning tool. The talk is oriented towards service-oriented architecture on IaaS vendors like Amazon. Mike will discuss the merits of a few available tools and introduce AWSHeet, which is a handy, if imperfect, way to provision resources.
We’ll have pizza and beer for everyone–don’t miss it! RSVP here.
