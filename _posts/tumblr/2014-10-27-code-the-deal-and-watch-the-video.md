What happens when you combine law and software engineering? One answer: last monthâ€™s Code the Deal hackathon, organized by the New York chapter of Legal Hackers and supported by the law firm Nixon Peabody LLP! Check out this short recap video to learn more about the hackathon, which Gilt supported via on-the-ground mentorship and post-hacking panel-discussing.
