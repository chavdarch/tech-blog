 #gilttech gives a hellaciously hot welcome to software engineer Nick Rogers, who joins Team Fire–the Dublin-based Gilt engineering team that’s currently focusing on SEO/SEM. Before joining Gilt, Nick spent five years working for a UX design and Development company, specializing in JavaScript applications and front-end development. “I do love working with JavaScript,” he says. “The whole front-end space has moved at a frantic pace over the last couple of years, and it’s been nice riding that wave!”
In his off hours Nick enjoys reading, music, football (fussball could well be a new love), Qi Gong, and spending time with his family. Welcome aboard, Nick!
