Earlier this morning Gilt VP Architecture Eric Bowman appeared on The Cloudcast: Aaron Delp and Brian Gracely’s great podcast on all things cloud computing, open source, APIs and more. Eric talks about the transformation of Gilt from monolithic Rails app to distributed Scala micro-services architecture, our tech culture and hiring practices, our embrace of open source technologies, our latest work with EC2 and Play Framework, and much more.
Go here to follow the Cloudcast on Twitter. And if you’re interested in working with Eric and our Dublin-based teams on tackling our exciting technical challenges, go here to check out our engineering opportunities in Ireland!
