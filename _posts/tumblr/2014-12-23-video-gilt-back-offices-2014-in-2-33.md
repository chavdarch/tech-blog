Gilt Director of Program Management Justin Riservato and Senior Director, Back Office Systems Christopher Hazlett wanted to list in a video everything the Back Office and Global Engineering teams accomplished in 2014. So they recruited other members of the Gilt PMO, found some markers and got to work. The cast:
Justin Riservato, Director
Mackenzie Nicholson, Actor
Patrick Richardson, Actor
Christopher Hazlett, Actor
Justin Vitale, Cinematographer
Heather Fleming, Moral Supporter
Lauri Apple, Composer
An extra shout-out to Justin Vitale, who stood almost perfectly straight for 1.5 hours while holding his iPhone to make this video possible.
