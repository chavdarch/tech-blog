It was one year ago today that we held our first free tech course at Gilt: an Introduction to Scala course hosted by our NYC office! Since then we’ve hosted twelve additional free courses in Scala, Hadoop, Machine Learning, Cassandra, AngularJS, and several other topics. Nearly 500 non-Gilt folks in NYC and Dublin have joined us for our full-day, classroom-style sessions, taught by Gilt technologists and external experts.
We’re excited to bring you many more free courses over the coming months, including next week’s AngularJS session in Dublin and our July 14 sbt workshop with Josh Suereth of Typesafe; just click the respective links to apply.
If you’re a tech expert who would like to pitch us for a course, feel free to ping us via Twitter. (Dublin or NYC residents only, unless you plan on swinging through one of these towns sometime over the next year.)
