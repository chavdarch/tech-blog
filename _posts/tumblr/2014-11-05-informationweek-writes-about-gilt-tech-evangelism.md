The IT publication InformationWeek recently spoke to me about what “tech evangelism” means at Gilt. An excerpt from “The IT Talent Shortage Debate,” written by IW Editor-in-Chief Laurianne McLaughlin:

… Gilt offers day-long courses on hot skills such as Scala and Hadoop, taught by experts, and has tech gurus such as former Netflix cloud architect Adrian Cockcroft come in to speak. Gilt invites the local tech community to attend and builds in time for networking.
“What I’m set up to do is raise awareness of what’s going on here, … and hopefully that will inspire people to apply,” Apple says.
