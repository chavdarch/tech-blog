NYCCHI is the NYC chapter of SIG-CHI, (Special Interest Group–Computer Human Interaction), and with nearly 2,000 members is the largest and oldest UX group in NYC. Tonight Gilt is hosting NYCCHI’s Internet of Things agency showcase featuring representatives from three reputable firms:
Rui Pereira of Havas’ Mad Sci Lab will discuss the UX design process for “Wherever Ships May Sail,” a film and interactive  installation created for Johnnie Walker
Fjord’s Chris Castenada and Chris Marotta will present their UX work on the “miCoach Smart Run” Adidas smartwatch
Frog’s Michael DelGaudio will present Frog’s UX work with GE on humanizing GE’s Industrial Internet applications. 

The Internet of Things (IoT) and Natural User Interfaces (NUI) are rapidly transforming how we live and interact. 2013 has marked a turning point with a confluence of near-universal mobile and device connectivity; rapidly standardizing data protocols and platforms and the advent of “big data” analytics; and the rise of alternate means of consumer interactions with digital devices through voice, gaze, touch, and motion. IoT and NUI present exciting challenges for UX professionals to consider new means of interactions beyond just the screen, mouse and keyboard, with new types of input and management of data as well as the marriage of hardware products and digital software design. 

There are still some tickets left for this exciting event–RSVP here!
