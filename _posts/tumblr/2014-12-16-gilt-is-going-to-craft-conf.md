2015 marks only the second year for Budapest, Hungary’s Craft Conf, but already the organizing team behind this software craftsmanship-centric conference have done a spectacular job of recruiting an A+ lineup of technologists from some of the globe’s most innovative companies. Case in point: Gilt’s own VP Engineering in Dublin, Adrian Trenaman (follow him on Twitter), will speak at Craft Conf 2015!
Adrian–or “Ade,” as we like to call him–will join Rent the Runway Engineering head/ZooKeeper committer Camille Fournier, Silicon Valley Product Group Founder Marty Cagan, Cognitect developer and past #gilttech speaker David Nolen, and other highly respected technologists in presenting at the conference, which takes place April 22 through 24, 2015. More details to come on Ade’s talk; meantime, keep up with conference announcements by following Craft on Twitter.
