If you want to see how SQL is applied to big data analytics, we have the perfect holiday present for you: A free, full-day course in advanced SQL and analytics!
Taught by our very own Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert, this eight-hour course will show you how SQL is applied in the big data field. You’ll also come away with a better understanding of what MapReduce is, and learn how to analyze click-stream data.
Basic Details:
When: Wednesday, Dec. 18 from 10:30 AM-6:30 PMWhere: Gilt, 2 Park Ave. in Manhattan, NYCWhat you need to bring: Your laptop, your brain, and one or two Capri Suns to drink with your lunch–which we will provide–for FREE (you’ll also get a free breakfast)
What Can I Expect?
Here’s the agenda (subject to change):
Quick SQL Refresher (with lab)
Anatomy of MPP database
Pros and cons of procedural and descriptive languages
Map/Reduce
SQL+Map-Reduce = SQL/MR (with lab)
SQL/MR use cases (click-stream analysis, calling domain-parsing APIs from SQL, etc)
Who Should Take This Course?
This class is perfect for you if you’re:
A data analyst who wants to get into big data or data science
A recent grad from one of the quantitative disciplines
a data enthusiast who has taught yourself SQL
A strong understanding of SELECT is expected. Fluency with JOINs, GROUP, ORDER, DISTINCT, HAVING, and COUNT is a must.
Besides the Free SQL Knowledge I’ll Acquire From Gilt’s Handsome and Brilliant Principal Data Scientist, What Else Do I Get?
Oh, maybe a job at Gilt? It’s true(!): We’re looking for a data analyst/consultant for a three-month gig starting ASAP, with the possibility of another three-month extension. You’ll munge our data from our NYC office (it’s quite posh and there’s ample amounts of chocolate candy hanging about–live a little!) and get to work alongside our data engineering team. This position will provide some exposure to machine learning, Teradata Aster and SQL/MapReduce on a massively parallel platform. A desire to understand the business side of things will come in handy. 
This sounds amazing. How can I prove to you that I am worthy?
One easy way to help your cause: Attend the free course! Let’s hang out for a day and see how it goes.
