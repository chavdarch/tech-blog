Gilt’s very own Mark Wunsch and Eric Shepherd are among the handful of engineers selected to attend Edge: a one-day conference, organized by Google and Financial Times Labs, that is happening today in NYC. Targeted to web developers, Edge features presentations on third-party scripts, real-time data, online payments and other topics; watch the videos to pretend like you’re there.
Proceeds from Edge benefit Girls Who Code, a nonprofit that works to eliminate the gender gap in science and tech (and whose work Gilt enthusiastically supports!).
Afternoon sessions:
